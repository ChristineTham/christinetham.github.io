Warning: this post is going to be controversial. By all means post your counter thoughts.\n\nFrom a macro perspective, we are definitely living in \"interesting times.\" We've come from a 30 year period of declining interest rates, which has fueled tech innovation funded by cheap capital. We have just survived a worldwide pandemic which has disrupted supply chains, and there is an energy crunch caused by a war and a perhaps a too slow transition to alternative energy sources to address climate change. The geopolitical axis is shifting, and rising nationalism seeks to redraw political boundaries and trade balances. Social media has changed the way we view the world and our behaviour and beliefs. AI will not only change the dynamics of the workforce but also the dynamics of creativity. The climate is changing, and perhaps we are also changing as a species, mentally and physically.\n\nWhat does all that mean in terms of #investing? First of all, some are predicting we are entering a potentially prolonged period of high volatility, interest rates and inflation. Many are saying the US will enter into a recession next year, and perhaps this will affect the rest of the world. We have become globalised and interconnected, and investment markets and asset classes around the world are increasingly correlated. Tech innovation and growth will slow down as the era of \"free capital\" disappears.\n\nSo here's the controversial part of my post. The fundamental rules of investing are changing. I believe Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) has failed us and may no longer apply in the future. The whole idea of MPT is that there is an efficient frontier from investing in a basket of diversified assets. That there is an \"optimal\" investment strategy depending on your risk tolerance.\n\nHowever, globalisation has reduced correlation between assets and markets. For perhaps the first time, we are seeing a decline in all asset classes. Decreased growth prospects and increased volatility may mean it no longer makes sense to (over) diversify. Liquidity, stability and income may become the new yardsticks of investing.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a shift from active investing (timed stock selection) to passive investing (tracking a market index). Perhaps there is no long term positive alpha, and even factor investing and the notion of picking value may be questionable.\n\nWhat remains? Minimising beta (volatility) is still worthwhile. There is some evidence that pursuing high income may lead to overall higher total return than pursuing growth, particularly as growth slows and sustainability becomes important. It may no longer makes sense to hold cash (rather than say a basket of liquid assets) and it may no longer makes sense to balance across asset classes just for the sake of balancing.\n\nHolding a basket of underlying stocks may be better than tracking an index. I may talk more about this in followup post, if there is interest.","filePath":"src/blog/2022-12-10-investment.md","digest":"ac10ac3c877bdd3d","rendered":{"html":"<p>Some investing thoughts as the end of year approaches.

He was a big man, but with a friendly, innocent face. He reminded me a lot of Andy Dufresne from Shawshank Redemption. I was instantly attracted to him.\n\nDuring the interrogation, they showed him a map of the city, and asked him which route he would take to go from point A to point B, which turnings, which roundabouts, etc.\n\nHis answers surprised them, given the facial expressions of the interrogators. I became convinced that whatever he was incarcerated for, he was innocent.\n\nOn the way back, he said he needed to go to a toilet. I took him to the nearest men's, which is accessible via a fancy bar. I waited outside the bar.\n\nWhilst he was in, I realised the toilet had a separate exit straight onto the street.

The garments trace the evolution of Zampatti’s style from the youthful spirit of the 1960s and 1970s to the relaxed sophistication of later years. The exhibition centres on the many beloved ‘Carlas’, retained for decades, and the stories through which Zampatti’s clothing is interwoven. Highlights include rarely seen designs from her early career and loans from clients including HRH Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Dame Quentin Bryce AD CVO, the Hon Linda Burney MP, and women from around Australia.\n\nTwo monumental audio and video installations explore Zampatti’s world through her own voice and intimate conversations between family, close friends, employees, clients and heads of businesses, arts, multicultural and charitable organisations which she supported over her lifetime.

A vibrant and diverse coastal metropolis, Sydney is home to iconic attractions, boasts a magnificent harbour and has a buzzing art, culinary and surf scene. With a calendar of exciting festivals and events, Sydney is the natural next destination of SEE LV’s 2022 journey. Mixing archival objects from the Maison’s heritage collection with recent creations, SEE LV allows visitors to delve deep into the world of Louis Vuitton through immersive and interactive digital experiences. Uncovering all facets of Louis Vuitton’s history and creations through a contemporary lens, the exhibition brings together a remarkable collection of modern pieces and early twentieth-century trunks, artistic collaborations and iconic leather creations.\n\nUpon entry, visitors are greeted by a portrait of young Louis Vuitton conceived by artist Refik Anadol using Artificial Intelligence. The exhibition continues to a room featuring a reverse-chronology selection of ready-to-wear pieces, where an exquisite 19th gown stands alongside a historical 1906 trunk, illustrating the Maison’s longstanding relationship with fashion. From the Steamer Trunk to the Speedy, Noe to Twist, a wall of Louis Vuitton’s most iconic bags and images of their celebrity friends such as Miranda Kerr, Jennifer Connelly, Samara Weaving, and Hugh Jackman display how these signature shapes have continued to inspire throughout the times. Next, an entire room is dedicated to Louis Vuitton’s major contributions to the invention of luggage typologies, ranging from the iconic Wardrobe trunk to the Skateboard trunk, showing how each one has been a cornerstone in the evolution of new lifestyles and traveling habits.

With a population of just under 3000, our delightful village is a gateway to Morton National Park where you can walk for miles and take in the breathtaking scenery.\n\n## Garden 1 (Viewland St)\n\nOriginally a timber cutter’s cottage dating back to 1906, the cottage was in place before the road was built.\n\nPlanned as low maintenance, with floral colour splashed about, the garden design has a circular pattern starting and finishing at two brick walls, incorporating a wisteria pergola.

Some have family members and loved ones that they haven't seen in years. Those who have deferred travel plans may have travel credits they may wish to use.\n\nUnless you have an urgent need to travel or expiring travel credits, I would avoid cross border travel for the next few years. Why?\nLet's deal with the most obvious, and less important reasons first.\n\nFirst of all, cost and frustration. Travel is relatively expensive at the moment, due to high inflation and fuel costs. Airlines globally shed staff during the pandemic lockdown, and the industry have collectively lost a lot of efficiency and effectiveness. Expect delays, cancellations, lost baggage and missed flights until things get sorted out again.\n\nSecondly, the pandemic isn't over. Last I checked, hundreds of thousands of people are still catching COVID-19 every day around the world. Vaccinations that protect against newer strains are only just coming out. There may be a new more deadly or infectious mutation around the corner. Borders can re-close very quickly and travellers could end up being stranded just like in 2020 when people were desperately trying to pay $50,000+ for first class tickets in a last ditch attempt to return home.\n\nThirdly, we have never been closer to World War III than right now. As you know, Russia invaded Ukraine but isn't winning. Russia's economy is tumbling due to the combined effect of funding the war and economic sanctions from other nations. Putin's future is increasingly shakey and rumours are his health isn't that great. The temptation to push that big red nuke button must be stronger each and every day and he has already threatened it. Biden has hinted retaliation in kind if that happens. China's economy isn't looking too great either due to the zero covid policy and collapse in the construction and tech industries - China might well be tempted to invade Taiwan if WW3 breaks out because China thinks the US will be distracted. All this translates to massive disruption and risk in travel. Remember MH17 was shot down over east Ukraine, and that was before the current conflict. Sure, none of this might happen in the near future. Or, it might.\n\nLastly (and the best reason): world markets are in severe decline due to a combination of fears (see above), inflation and rising interest rates. The best time to save money is RIGHT NOW. As a friend of mine used to say, a market crash is like an end of year clearance sale at your department store - it's time to hunt for bargains. Eventually it will be a great time to invest. Our portfolio doubled in value after the GFC. Any money you save can go towards making you more money in the short term. All it requires is patience and a keen nose for bargains.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0NWWh8BFBDCxpPGBzysCLAsTYe2wHXGDzXz2CLEFhr1ipXbhqpUqDFXpfeEMbmzqdl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"298\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","filePath":"src/blog/2022-10-11-travel.md","digest":"9a501173a230ca96","rendered":{"html":"<p>Many of us have pandemic fatigue and it is tempting to book that overseas holiday now that restrictions are being lifted and borders are opened.

Although we retired in 2020, last financial year was the first year we had to survive purely on investment income.\n\nAs you may remember, this time last year I was in a bit of a panic. Many companies in our portfolio had slashed their dividends due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and at one stage it seemed we may not have enough income to live on.\n\nI brushed up my Python skills, and ran a number of portfolio optimisation algorithms in an attempt to rebalance our portfolio to generate more income.\n\nI was mainly focused on ASX quality stocks that paid a steady stream of fully franked dividends, or high income ETFs. Some people criticised my approach on social media. Apparently I should be investing in globally diversified funds, or cryptocurrency, and I am missing out on the massive growth in tech stocks.

The bus normally stops close to our house, but today for some reason terminated a few stops early. Rather than wait for the next bus, I decided to walk home.\n\nOn the way, I passed through a terrace house that has been converted into a shop. The window display looked interesting, so I decided to pop in.\n\nI thought it might be a photography supplies shop, but that turned out to be window dressing, it is actually a bookshop. The owner was a bit surprised to see me, and said they are closing soon. I said that's okay as I will just browse until closing time.\n\nThe shop/house turned out to be a lot bigger than I thought. From street level, it seemed like a single storey, but it is built on the side of a hill and has multiple levels stretching all the way down to the back street down the hill.\n\nThe level below the main store is the children's section. It is very whimsically decorated and I enjoyed it immensely. Below that is a second hand section. I had a slightly uncomfortable feeling these books are not a random selection but the previous owner's collection. There were a lot of music books and books from specific authors and subjects. Below that the carpet gets a bit moldy and there was a damp smell.\n\nOn the lowest level, there is an open space which used to be a garage but has been converted into a stationery and knick knack area of the bookshop. I saw a robot dressed as a policeman and to my surprise it started to dance! It looked very realistic and I thought it was a human at first but it moved a little too quick to be organic.\n\nAfter the robots, a baby elephant and a giraffe danced. These are animatronic robots too. A crowd started gathering to watch the robots. I took out my camera and started filming a video.\n\nThe last robot was a bit creepy. It was actually dressed as a metallic robot, but it seemed sentient, it was interacting with the audience and speaking to them. It seemed to know who I am, and it made a racist joke about the two Sri Lankans next to me that I was very uncomfortable with.","filePath":"src/blog/2022-09-22-dream.md","digest":"62a2f4489c25b5d6","rendered":{"html":"<p>Today’s dream: I am on bus going home.

Through light, sound and a multi-sensory narrative, the sculpture draws us together and speculatively captures the alternative trajectories in the life cycle of stars.\n\nGravity affects all things with mass or energy and brings them toward one another. It is responsible for the birth of galaxies and the perceptual relativity of time and space. While impossible to witness with human sensory perception, the sculpture acts as a device that unveils the intricacy of gravity’s effect on light and its pervasive interconnection to all forms.\n\nLight, sound, structure and the spaces they create play a key role in our rituals, which might lead to meaning, insight, and transcendence. In response to the recent events that have distanced our social body and separated people around the globe, the work is a monument to the importance of communal experience.

Through light, sound and a multi-sensory narrative, the sculpture draws us together and speculatively captures the alternative trajectories in the life cycle of stars.</p>\n<p>Gravity affects all things with mass or energy and brings them toward one another. It is responsible for the birth of galaxies and the perceptual relativity of time and space. While impossible to witness with human sensory perception, the sculpture acts as a device that unveils the intricacy of gravity’s effect on light and its pervasive interconnection to all forms.</p>\n<p>Light, sound, structure and the spaces they create play a key role in our rituals, which might lead to meaning, insight, and transcendence. In response to the recent events that have distanced our social body and separated people around the globe, the work is a monument to the importance of communal experience. It brings us together again, just like gravity.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=314&#x26;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fvideos%2F596469084974891%2F&#x26;show_text=false&#x26;width=560&#x26;t=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n<h2 id=\"kia-morphia\">Kia Morphia</h2>\n<p>This is Kia-Morphia at Vivid Sydney #vividsydney.

It plays an indispensable role in Australia’s engagement with the world, and a meaningful role in the life of the nation. The Biennale presents the most dynamic contemporary art from around the globe in venues across Sydney with exhibitions that ignite and surprise people, sparking dialogue, cultivating connections and inspiring action through meaningful, shared arts experiences. The Biennale of Sydney amplifies the voices of artists and tell the stories of our global communities, as they drive momentum for lasting cultural change.\n\nEstablished in 1973, it is the third oldest biennial in the world after Venice and São Paulo and the largest exhibition of its kind in Australia. The Biennale of Sydney has commissioned and presented exceptional works of art by more than 2,000 national and international artists from more than 130 countries.\n\nRivers, wetlands and other salt and freshwater ecosystems feature in the 23rd Biennale of Sydney (2022), titled rīvus, as dynamic living systems with varying degrees of political agency. Indigenous knowledges have long understood non-human entities as living ancestral beings with a right to life that must be protected. But only recently have animals, plants, mountains and bodies of water been granted legal personhood. If we can recognise them as individual beings, what might they say?\n\nrīvus invites several aqueous beings into a dialogue with artists, architects, designers, scientists, and communities, entangling multiple voices and other modes of communication to ask unlikely questions: Can a river sue us over psychoactive sewage? Will oysters grow teeth in aquatic revenge? What do the eels think? Are the swamp oracles speaking in tongues? Do algae reminisce about the days of primordial soup? Are waves the ocean’s desire? Can a waterfall refuse gravity? Considering the water ecology’s perspective entails a fundamental shift in understanding our relationship with the rest of the natural world as a porous chronicle of interwoven fates.\n\nRivers are the sediment of culture. They are givers of life, routes of communication, places of ritual, sewers and mass graves. They are witnesses and archives, our memory. As such, they have also been co-opted as natural avenues for the colonial enterprise, becoming sites of violent conflict driven by greed, exploitation and the thirst to possess. Indeed, the latin root rīvus, meaning a brook or stream, is also at the origin of the word rivalry.\n\nThe 23rd Biennale of Sydney is articulated around a series of conceptual wetlands situated along waterways of the Gadigal, Barramatagal and Cabrogal peoples. These imagined ecosystems are populated by artworks, experiments, activisms and research, which together follow the currents of meandering tributaries, expanding out into a delta of interrelated ideas including river horror, creek futurism, Indigenous science, cultural flows, ancestral technologies, counter-mapping, queer ecologies, multispecies justice, hydrofeminism, water healing, spirit streams, fish philosophy and sustainable methods of co-existence.\n\nSustainability should be an action, not a theme. rīvus will reflect on its own conditions of possibility, becoming the catalyst for works already in progress; encouraging the use of non-polluting materials and production processes; advocating for locality, collectivity, collaboration and reduced waste; acknowledging its own impact on the environment while aiming to lower it through a systemic and creative approach.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0jG1eYhBUQGcvGEvd7uHRtJYoDkLecQvub6fNkuZCGqiuZeTKs9dHFs7SJj3shZDpl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"645\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n\nMore Biennale photos - these ones are from MCA\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid024mkpYwVw6XM7VpxSjUs3SZYha3bKXHSf62tVADjxUXjcmXSoRWw9QYQudK51gDyfl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"645\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","filePath":"src/blog/2022-03-16-bos23.md","assetImports":["../gallery/2022-03-16-bos23/BOS23 Rivus Barangaroo.jpeg"],"digest":"610c3bb2192a791d","rendered":{"html":"<p>Exploring the 23rd Biennale at Barangaroo</p>\n<p>The Biennale of Sydney is one of the leading international contemporary art events.
