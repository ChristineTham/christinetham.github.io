After that I didn’t want to ride anymore, so I went back by myself via Pacific Highway.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid031tFZ6TwLEj8Z7eBcDpGUBQGznesZA4QhMvSV2VbP6vdu5waZ2MWjV9SmjumNbeKvl&#x26;show_text=true&#x26;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"438\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","metadata":{"headings":[],"imagePaths":[],"frontmatter":{"title":"A very short ride","pubDate":"2023-03-18T22:00:00.000Z","images":["../images/cycling/Zeal short ride.png"],"description":"Decided to abort a ride after someone had an accident","categories":["cycling"],"tags":["Zeal"],"minutesRead":"1 min read","extra":[]}}},"collection":"blog"},{"id":"2023-03-18-stanley-st","data":{"title":"SydneyStreets Stanley St Festival","description":"Wandering around the city, and ending up at Stanley St","pubDate":"2023-03-18T01:00:00.000Z","categories":["travel"],"coverImage":{"src":"/2023/_astro/Sydney Streets on Stanley.Ct_DV8Tu.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"jpg","orientation":1},"gallery":"2023-03-18-stanley-st","tags":["Sofitel","SydneyStreets","Stanley St","Martin Place"]},"body":"We walked around the city today, starting from Wynyard Station, then walking up Martin Place, stopping by at Sofitel Wentworth, and ended up attending #SydneyStreets at Stanley St before walking back via Liverpool St to catch the train.\n\nIn Chatswood, I managed to take photo of a cockatoo having breakfast:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02SsMvztR2CutvfvAexauXUtNxKmqCMutZm33rzRtnr7H2pJPkUHRbjgN4dcxyVKnDl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"590\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n\nAt Martin Place:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02QuEhy6iY4YyUjoomEy6GhxLpkxKRTusJKnZ8PjSGFxq6qhqc3mYiSFKqhTQPqgdQl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"562\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n\nAt the Sofitel Wentworth - there is a Tour de France photo exhibition here which was interesting.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02UUqzgNU6thKyNxTcEusFU2XQ78LBUK7scpm6graLsoGBoKZhiqMJurmwgqPs1yuil&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"582\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n\n#SydneyStreets on Stanley St - catching up with the vibe on the street - we tried some Japanese snacks and some dumplings - both were delicious.

For this analysis, I am selecting Betashares' Australian Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (CRED). Again, I am not picking on Betashares, the behaviour of other bond ETFs would no doubt be similar.\n\nThe reason I am selecting CRED is because the underlying index (Solactive Australian Investment Grade Corporate Bond Select TR Index) has a simple methodology - it consists of 50 corporate bonds (ranked by quality and option adjusted spread) with equal weightings. Other indices, such as Bloomberg's Australian Composite Bond has a much larger universe and hence more difficult to analyse.\n\nThe issue we saw in the previous analysis (where a bond ETF may result in significant negative total return in a falling market with rising interest rates) is also present in CRED.\n\nIt is tempting to tolerate this performance because the ETF performance is simply reflecting current market conditions and on the surface appear to track the index performance reasonably well. This is by design: ETF fund managers monitor tracking error closely and ensures their funds track the underlying index with minimal deviation.\n\nBut does the ETF truly track the index in terms of portfolio composition?\n\nConsider this: during good times in a rising market, the funds receives regular net inflows and can just buy more bonds more or less in accordance to index weight.\n\nBut in a falling market, where there is a net redemption, the fund is eventually forced to sell assets (bonds). Unlike the equity market, individual bonds can be quite illiquid and it may be quite difficult for the fund to sell assets in accordance to the desired weighting. Hence a fund is forced to choose between two alternatives: sell the more liquid bonds (which will degrade the overall quality of the portfolio over time) or try to get rid of the illiquid bonds, which may impact the underlying liquidity and and further reduce the market value of these assets, as well as incur additional transaction costs.\n\nOver time, therefore, one would expect the aftermath of a sustained falling market (such as what happened in 2022) will result in an ETF with a portfolio that significantly deviates from the idealised index weightings.\n\nAnd that has indeed happened with CRED. If I analyse the current portfolio holdings, the weightings of the bonds range from 1% to 3% instead of the ideal (2%). This means over time the credit risk of the portfolio can deviate significantly from the notional index risk even if the total return may not deviate that much.\n\nWhat does that mean for an investor? Be careful of buying ETFs where the underlying physical assets may not be liquid, as over time (particular after a significant market fall or times of crisis) the ETF may not reflect the underlying index well, even if tracking error appears to be low. This is not just bond ETFs but any ETF (particularly the thematic ones).\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02EXu7qPr6ZjnLpuSPWZkwqKM8d1TDcyHx6wLUjEXm1d1AEKLkAMBw1oBfoxAZ9eBSl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"621\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","filePath":"src/blog/2023-03-14-cred.md","assetImports":["../images/blog/CRED total return.png","../images/blog/CRED index.png"],"digest":"f81b2762b20aff0b","rendered":{"html":"<p>Continuing my series on analysing ETF performance, let’s look more closely at how a typical bond ETF might perform.

Hence a fund is forced to choose between two alternatives: sell the more liquid bonds (which will degrade the overall quality of the portfolio over time) or try to get rid of the illiquid bonds, which may impact the underlying liquidity and and further reduce the market value of these assets, as well as incur additional transaction costs.</p>\n<p>Over time, therefore, one would expect the aftermath of a sustained falling market (such as what happened in 2022) will result in an ETF with a portfolio that significantly deviates from the idealised index weightings.</p>\n<p>And that has indeed happened with CRED. If I analyse the current portfolio holdings, the weightings of the bonds range from 1% to 3% instead of the ideal (2%). This means over time the credit risk of the portfolio can deviate significantly from the notional index risk even if the total return may not deviate that much.</p>\n<p>What does that mean for an investor? Be careful of buying ETFs where the underlying physical assets may not be liquid, as over time (particular after a significant market fall or times of crisis) the ETF may not reflect the underlying index well, even if tracking error appears to be low. This is not just bond ETFs but any ETF (particularly the thematic ones).</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02EXu7qPr6ZjnLpuSPWZkwqKM8d1TDcyHx6wLUjEXm1d1AEKLkAMBw1oBfoxAZ9eBSl&#x26;show_text=true&#x26;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"621\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","metadata":{"headings":[],"imagePaths":[],"frontmatter":{"title":"Bond ETF analysis continued","description":"A Look at CRED performance and composition","pubDate":"2023-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","images":["../images/blog/CRED total return.png","../images/blog/CRED index.png"],"categories":["create"],"tags":["investment","bond","ETF"],"minutesRead":"3 min read","extra":[]}}},"collection":"blog"},{"id":"2023-03-14-pink-trail","data":{"title":"Pink Trail","description":"Pink top from SES matched with a Forever New pink mini skirt","pubDate":"2023-03-13T22:00:00.000Z","categories":["fashion"],"images":[{"src":"/2023/_astro/Pink trail.BmtGXSrw.jpeg","width":2560,"height":2560,"format":"jpg","orientation":1}],"tags":["pink","SES","Forever New","dress"]},"body":"Today, I am wearing it to the lunch at F&L Gournet.","filePath":"src/blog/2023-03-14-pink-trail.md","assetImports":["../images/fashion/Pink trail.jpeg"],"digest":"457e71b0b0f341e8","rendered":{"html":"<p>Today, I am wearing it to the lunch at F&#x26;L Gournet.</p>","metadata":{"headings":[],"imagePaths":[],"frontmatter":{"title":"Pink Trail","pubDate":"2023-03-13T22:00:00.000Z","description":"Pink top from SES matched with a Forever New pink mini skirt","images":["../images/fashion/Pink trail.jpeg"],"categories":["fashion"],"tags":["pink","SES","Forever New","dress"],"minutesRead":"1 min read","extra":[]}}},"collection":"blog"},{"id":"2023-03-13-cat-cooking","data":{"title":"Cat Cooking Class","description":"Three Thai appetisers featuring pork","pubDate":"2023-03-13T06:00:00.000Z","categories":["food"],"images":[{"src":"/2023/_astro/Thai Appetizers cooking class.BaR17BIV.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"jpg","orientation":1},{"src":"/2023/_astro/Pork toast (5).yIMlv9Q1.jpeg","width":1707,"height":2560,"format":"jpg","orientation":1}],"tags":["Chinese","lunch","restaurant","Macquarie Centre","FL Gourmet"]},"body":"Thai Appetisers cooking class with Cat Bowrey.

Some pointed out that comparing an ETF that rebalances with the index with a static holding is like comparing apples and oranges.\n\nI have been thinking about this, and I have a hypothesis that ETF rebalancing can result in underperformance, even if we assume zero transaction costs.\n\nMy hypothesis lies in the fact that most indexes change the weightings of assets that comprise the index relatively infrequently (possibly quarterly or even semi-annually), but an ETF has to rebalance much more frequently in order to minimise tracking error. It is not unusual for an ETF to rebalance at least monthly, and possibly weekly or even daily.\n\nSo the ETF ends up rebalancing against a lagging index, creating a situation where the rebalance is seemingly counter-productive - it will buy more of stocks that are falling in price and sell off stocks that have increased in price - only to have to reverse the transactions once the index readjust weightings. So, basically a buy high sell low strategy.\n\nTo prove this, I modelled a very simple market with 2 stocks over 6 pricing periods, both initially priced at $1 with a market cap of $1000. So the initial weighting of both stocks is 50% in the index. The index weighting is adjusted every 3 periods (eg. quarterly), against an ETF that rebalances every period (eg. monthly).\n\nI then tested three scenarios: a rising market where the two stocks rises at different rates, a falling market where both stocks fall at different rates, and a mixed market consisting of 1 rising stock and 1 falling stock. As can be seen from the attached spreadsheet screenshots, in all three scenarios the hypothetical ETF ends up underperforming compared to holding the assets statically (the \"correct\" behaviour since the stock's relative market cap is in line with their price changes).\n\nWhat does this imply? Ideally ETFs should rebalance at the same frequency as (or less often than) the underlying index weight adjustments.

Some pointed out that comparing an ETF that rebalances with the index with a static holding is like comparing apples and oranges.</p>\n<p>I have been thinking about this, and I have a hypothesis that ETF rebalancing can result in underperformance, even if we assume zero transaction costs.</p>\n<p>My hypothesis lies in the fact that most indexes change the weightings of assets that comprise the index relatively infrequently (possibly quarterly or even semi-annually), but an ETF has to rebalance much more frequently in order to minimise tracking error. It is not unusual for an ETF to rebalance at least monthly, and possibly weekly or even daily.</p>\n<p>So the ETF ends up rebalancing against a lagging index, creating a situation where the rebalance is seemingly counter-productive - it will buy more of stocks that are falling in price and sell off stocks that have increased in price - only to have to reverse the transactions once the index readjust weightings. So, basically a buy high sell low strategy.</p>\n<p>To prove this, I modelled a very simple market with 2 stocks over 6 pricing periods, both initially priced at <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>k</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">1 with a market cap of </annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02691em;\">w</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">i</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">t</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">hama</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">r</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03148em;\">k</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">e</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">t</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">c</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">a</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">p</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">o</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10764em;\">f</span></span></span></span>1000. So the initial weighting of both stocks is 50% in the index. The index weighting is adjusted every 3 periods (eg. quarterly), against an ETF that rebalances every period (eg. monthly).</p>\n<p>I then tested three scenarios: a rising market where the two stocks rises at different rates, a falling market where both stocks fall at different rates, and a mixed market consisting of 1 rising stock and 1 falling stock. As can be seen from the attached spreadsheet screenshots, in all three scenarios the hypothetical ETF ends up underperforming compared to holding the assets statically (the “correct” behaviour since the stock’s relative market cap is in line with their price changes).</p>\n<p>What does this imply? Ideally ETFs should rebalance at the same frequency as (or less often than) the underlying index weight adjustments. However, this may result in large tracking errors that ETF managers (or the market) may not be prepared to weather. It also means the individual investor may be better off purchasing the underlying assets and doing manual rebalancing compared to buying an ETF.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02JP1qUD8ZPJgPTEu26JJZQiA8qM1R33tN4NnU1jTdRErm4dAGKQwwfJ4u4owYUcvRl&#x26;show_text=true&#x26;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"767\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","metadata":{"headings":[],"imagePaths":[],"frontmatter":{"title":"ETF performance","description":"Compared to holding the underlying physical assets","pubDate":"2023-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","images":["../images/blog/Rising Market.png","../images/blog/Falling Market.png","../images/blog/Mixed Market.png"],"categories":["create"],"tags":["investment","ETF"],"minutesRead":"3 min read","extra":["math"]}}},"collection":"blog"},{"id":"2023-03-10-trivia","data":{"title":"Trivia and Buffet Dinner Fundraiser for Afghan Women","description":"Afghan buffet dinner at Alexandria Town Hall","pubDate":"2023-03-10T11:00:00.000Z","categories":["food","event"],"images":[{"src":"/2023/_astro/Trivia and Buffet Fundraiser for Afghan Women (5).20k6Z40T.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"jpg","orientation":1},{"src":"/2023/_astro/Alexandria Town Hall.BNHHIApI.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"jpg","orientation":1},{"src":"/2023/_astro/Trivia and Buffet Fundraiser for Afghan Women (6).CjvzszSg.jpeg","width":1707,"height":2560,"format":"jpg","orientation":1}],"tags":["Afghan","dinner","trivia","fundraising"]},"body":"Trivia and Buffet Dinner Fundraiser for Afghan Women at Alexandria Town Hall, 73 Garden Street organised by Welcome Merchant.\n\nThe trivia was hosted by the hilarious Jennifer Wong (ABC's Chopsticks or Fork show) and was also a celebration of International Women's Day.\n\nWelcome Merchant is a social enterprise that provides a free online directory and digital marketing support to entrepreneurs who identify as a refugee and as a person seeking asylum.

I particularly liked the Infinite Skyscraper (Guts) and the End of Imagination.\n\nThe Sydney Modern Project has transformed the Art Gallery of New South Wales into a unique art museum campus with two buildings and an art garden, on Gadigal Country, overlooking one of the world’s most beautiful harbours.\n\nDesigned by award-winning architects SANAA, the new building is a series of light-filled pavilions and graceful outdoor terraces that step down towards Sydney Harbour. A vast rammed earth wall cuts a dramatic curve through the building. On the lowest level of the building, discover a space like no other in Sydney: a reclaimed underground fuel bunker built during World War II and previously inaccessible to the public, which is now home to the first of a series of art projects.\n\nFor The End of Imagination, the inaugural exhibition in the Tank, Villar Rojas takes a unique opportunity to dramatise and radicalise the experience of this former wartime oil bunker that few have seen before. Set in extreme darkness where limits are not known, a host of moving lights operate as sentient beings seeking, surveying, locating, following their own paths and patterns, changing them according to their own needs and will, not ours. Among the shadows, this collective artificial gaze uncovers conflicted objects in a space that was itself born of conflict.\n\nThese traumatised objects are the product of a sculptural experiment, a hypothesis impossible to test on the terrestrial plane. Using an amalgamation of software systems collectively described as the ‘Time Engine’, Villar Rojas generated a series of intensely detailed digital worlds and placed virtual sculptures within them.\n\nSimulating conditions ranging from environmental to sociopolitical across timespans ranging from hours to millennia, the Time Engine poses unanswerable questions: What monuments might be created to commemorate the end of postcolonial struggles for independence on the Moon’s Sea of Clouds in the year 34,340? What would a sculpture that was left in the canyon of the Valles Marineris on Mars for 500 years look like? What is its texture, what remains of its volume? How do you model wind in 7,374,000 BCE?\n\nAs the extreme conditions of each world bore down on the sculptures, they became ever more complex and harrowed. Fires scorched them, altered gravity distorted them. Unrest toppled them, wars wounded them. Other life forms sheltered within or bloomed upon them. The artist modelled worlds, which in turn modelled the sculptures.\n\nIn late 2021, Villar Rojas and his team ‘downloaded’ these time-travelling virtual sculptures and commenced the labour of reconstituting them physically, his aim being to bring home faithfully the trials they endured on their journeys through turbulent digital worlds. Made with forensic intensity in a temporary workshop in Rosario, Argentina, where hands-on making was combined with machine intelligence, the resulting sculptures are layered composites of metals, plastics, concrete, soil, glass, salt, wax, resin, tree barks, metal, salvaged auto parts, recycled plastics, and a multitude of other organic and inorganic materials.\n\nIn this complex and provocative installation, both sculptures and the Tank itself – whose walls are stained with oil, graffiti and mineral traces – allude to all they’ve been through while opening still larger questions. Are they survivors or prophets? Should we revere or fear them? What discomforting knowledge do they bring us?\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0vNgJNa6ttR9k4yHrWv8g7ZLuV2RoPkDnYgE4Apfi1iRY6gFa2z8DEYSZdES335E1l&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"812\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","filePath":"src/blog/2023-03-03-art-gallery.md","assetImports":["../gallery/2023-03-03-art-gallery/Flowers that Bloom in the Cosmos (Yayoi Kusama) (1).jpeg"],"digest":"0acb49162f2ab72d","rendered":{"html":"<p>The new North building of the Art Gallery - some really impressive large scale artworks here.

The artist modelled worlds, which in turn modelled the sculptures.</p>\n<p>In late 2021, Villar Rojas and his team ‘downloaded’ these time-travelling virtual sculptures and commenced the labour of reconstituting them physically, his aim being to bring home faithfully the trials they endured on their journeys through turbulent digital worlds. Made with forensic intensity in a temporary workshop in Rosario, Argentina, where hands-on making was combined with machine intelligence, the resulting sculptures are layered composites of metals, plastics, concrete, soil, glass, salt, wax, resin, tree barks, metal, salvaged auto parts, recycled plastics, and a multitude of other organic and inorganic materials.</p>\n<p>In this complex and provocative installation, both sculptures and the Tank itself – whose walls are stained with oil, graffiti and mineral traces – allude to all they’ve been through while opening still larger questions. Are they survivors or prophets? Should we revere or fear them? What discomforting knowledge do they bring us?</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0vNgJNa6ttR9k4yHrWv8g7ZLuV2RoPkDnYgE4Apfi1iRY6gFa2z8DEYSZdES335E1l&#x26;show_text=true&#x26;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"812\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","metadata":{"headings":[],"imagePaths":[],"frontmatter":{"title":"The North Building of the Art Gallery","description":"The Art Gallery of NSW has been transformed into an art museum campus with the addition of the new North Building.","pubDate":"2023-03-03T05:00:00.000Z","coverImage":"../gallery/2023-03-03-art-gallery/Flowers that Bloom in the Cosmos (Yayoi Kusama) (1).jpeg","gallery":"2023-03-03-art-gallery","categories":["art"],"tags":["Sydney","art Gallery"],"minutesRead":"3 min read","extra":[]}}},"collection":"blog"},{"id":"2023-03-03-mca","data":{"title":"Walking around the Rocks and MCA","description":"Photos taken during the World Pride event","pubDate":"2023-03-03T01:00:00.000Z","categories":["art","event"],"coverImage":{"src":"/2023/_astro/Free to be (1).Da6ds6y7.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1709,"format":"jpg","orientation":1},"gallery":"2023-03-03-mca","tags":["The Rocks","MCA","World Pride"]},"body":"Wandering around the Rocks and Museum of Contemporary Art Australia\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0ftT78iBfGyye57Y2q7YVzCBbcnCGj3HvJWwHjFEj7Et5HpPCPxCuyB9BD7V7tb1l&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"562\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","filePath":"src/blog/2023-03-03-mca.md","assetImports":["../gallery/2023-03-03-mca/Free to be (1).jpeg"],"digest":"dc1c0736812e4b00","rendered":{"html":"<p>Wandering around the Rocks and Museum of Contemporary Art Australia</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0ftT78iBfGyye57Y2q7YVzCBbcnCGj3HvJWwHjFEj7Et5HpPCPxCuyB9BD7V7tb1l&#x26;show_text=true&#x26;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"562\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","metadata":{"headings":[],"imagePaths":[],"frontmatter":{"title":"Walking around the Rocks and MCA","description":"Photos taken during the World Pride event","pubDate":"2023-03-03T01:00:00.000Z","coverImage":"../gallery/2023-03-03-mca/Free to be (1).jpeg","gallery":"2023-03-03-mca","categories":["art","event"],"tags":["The Rocks","MCA","World Pride"],"minutesRead":"1 min read","extra":[]}}},"collection":"blog"},{"id":"2023-03-03-salesforce","data":{"title":"Salesforce Tower","description":"Tallest office building in Sydney","pubDate":"2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","categories":["travel"],"coverImage":{"src":"/2023/_astro/SalesForce Tower (2).Ds0KnWhr.jpeg","width":2560,"height":2560,"format":"jpg","orientation":1},"gallery":"2023-03-03-salesforce","tags":["Sydney","SalesForce Rower"]},"body":"The new $1.5b SalesForce Tower, the tallest office building in Sydney.

Durango is centrally located between Denver, Albuquerque, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City.\n\nIn the Wahoo RGT recreation of the ride, in the first 4km the ride simulator makes you compete with a train - if you are not fast enough the train overtakes you (oh the embarrassment), then you have to climb a hill, and then do a sprint. Fortunately today, I beat the train by cycling at an average over 30 km/h for the 4km, then achieved a personal best on the climb and the sprint.

Conceived as a cacophonous, kaleidoscopic ‘gesamtkunstwerk’, WORD MADE FLESH imagines a queer alternative reality, erected from the wasteland of the Anthropocene, performatively implicating itself into the debased spectacle of hyper-capitalist society.  Curated by Max Delany, in collaboration with Paul Yore and Devon Ackerman.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02bYErZoJG9BBtsq6rX1sM7T3tMMmbPURyWg87dyKvMiFXyLCJ8NTZARdtsJ8kDo9Gl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"793\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","filePath":"src/blog/2023-02-23-carriageworks.md","assetImports":["../gallery/2023-02-23-carriageworks/Word Made Flesh (Paul Yore).jpeg"],"digest":"27b814a9f5835448","rendered":{"html":"<p>Visiting Carriageworks where a number of World Pride performances and exhibitions\nare being held.

Conceived as a cacophonous, kaleidoscopic ‘gesamtkunstwerk’, WORD MADE FLESH imagines a queer alternative reality, erected from the wasteland of the Anthropocene, performatively implicating itself into the debased spectacle of hyper-capitalist society.  Curated by Max Delany, in collaboration with Paul Yore and Devon Ackerman.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02bYErZoJG9BBtsq6rX1sM7T3tMMmbPURyWg87dyKvMiFXyLCJ8NTZARdtsJ8kDo9Gl&#x26;show_text=true&#x26;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"793\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","metadata":{"headings":[{"depth":2,"slug":"marri-madung-butbut-many-brave-hearts-first-nations-gathering-space","text":"Marri Madung Butbut (Many Brave Hearts): First Nations Gathering Space"},{"depth":2,"slug":"amsterdam-rainbow-dress","text":"Amsterdam Rainbow Dress"},{"depth":2,"slug":"paul-yore-word-made-flesh","text":"Paul Yore: Word Made Flesh"}],"imagePaths":[],"frontmatter":{"title":"World Pride exhibitions at Carriageworks","pubDate":"2023-02-23T03:00:00.000Z","coverImage":"../gallery/2023-02-23-carriageworks/Word Made Flesh (Paul Yore).jpeg","gallery":"2023-02-23-carriageworks","description":"Word Made Flesh and the Amsterdam Rainbow Dress","categories":["event","art"],"tags":["art","World Pride","Carriageworks","Paul Yore"],"minutesRead":"3 min read","extra":[]}}},"collection":"blog"},{"id":"2023-02-22-masak-masak","data":{"title":"Masak masak","description":"Cooking a variety of dishes at Eemie's place","pubDate":"2023-02-22T06:00:00.000Z","categories":["food"],"images":[{"src":"/2023/_astro/Masak masak.DZZOPaRw.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1707,"format":"jpg","orientation":1},{"src":"/2023/_astro/Masak masak (2).CpA2k_KO.jpeg","width":2560,"height":2560,"format":"jpg","orientation":1}],"tags":["Malaysian","lunch","MFLS"]},"body":"From makan makan to masak masak - cooking session hosted by Eemie Ong and featuring a variety of dishes including Adeline Lamond's secret family recipe for yee sang, nin gao, goreng pisang, fried pineapple, fried Mars bars, king prawns, okra, fried rice, salted fish and finishing off with delicious estella and fruit platter.

After all, we are already using models with billions and trillions of parameters - what if we use models with a greater number of parameters than the neurons in a human brain?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/\">What Is ChatGPT Doing … and Why Does It Work?</a></p>","metadata":{"headings":[],"imagePaths":[],"frontmatter":{"title":"Thoughts about ChatGPT","description":"Link to a good article by Stephen Wolfram, plus thoughts","pubDate":"2023-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","coverImage":"../images/undraw_chat.svg","socialImage":"../images/undraw_chat.png","categories":["software"],"tags":["ChatGPT","Stephen Wolfram","AI","language models"],"minutesRead":"3 min read","extra":[]}}},"collection":"blog"},{"id":"2023-02-18-mink-pink","data":{"title":"Mink Pink","description":"Mandarin collar oriental inspired dress","pubDate":"2023-02-17T22:00:00.000Z","categories":["fashion"],"images":[{"src":"/2023/_astro/Minkpink.C9Y6gZtS.jpeg","width":2560,"height":2560,"format":"jpg","orientation":1}],"tags":["dress","Mink Pink","preloved","vinnies","red"]},"body":"Bought from St Vinnies #preloved.

I wont disagree, even though I have a soft spot for the 1959 Serafin recording with Tebaldi. In any case, I have been searching for this LP set for most of my life.\n\nIt is in good condition, and comes with the libretto. Even better, it is quite moldy - which is a good sign for record collectors. Mold means nobody has played the record in years, and often the LPs will sound excellent after cleaning.\n\nSure enough, I was very happy after playing back Sides 3 and 4 (corresponding to Acts 3 and 4).\n\nAlthough I am generally not a fan of Karajan for Italian operas (I find him a bit too ponderous and not \"Italian\" enough), he is perfect for Acts 3 and 4 and the interpretation and performance simply cannot be faulted.\n\nHe is in absolute control of the orchestra and Germanic precision wins over Italian passion as every note sounds perfectly crafted, and yet totally in place and in context with the other notes.\n\nKarajan is smart and humble enough to work in sympathy with the singers and the orchestra is never in competition with them. He gives space to allow the singers to express themselves fully, and never have I heard more dynamic range in the vocals than in this recording.\n\nThis recording is proof of John Culshaw's thesis that sometimes it is better to listen to an opera recording rather than experiencing it live on stage. Made in the heyday of operatic studio recordings, this was specially commissioned by Decca and recorded with beautiful acoustics at the Jesus Christus Kirche in Berlin.\nBecause the singers know it is a studio recording and the mics will capture every breath faithfully, they are brave enough to vary their dynamic range all the way down to a whisper, and hearing this on an LP is a revelation compared to the muddy and indistinct CD.\n\nPavarotti in particular demonstrates just why he was regarded as the world's greatest tenor. He manages to evoke emotion in every note - you know exactly how he is feeling without requiring an understanding of Italian. His voice is perfect, beautifully crafted and absolutely sublime.\n\nFreni was in her prime and amply demonstrates why she is famous for her Mimi, and she is such a professional she takes the trouble to evoke some very realistic TB sounding coughs whilst maintaining a sweet singing voice.\n\nAct 3 is wonderful demonstration of how restrained the singers and the orchestra are. Rather than projecting and belting out the lines, the singers evoke such tenderness and regret. The moment that Rodolfo changes from criticising Mimi to admitting he is terrified she is gravely ill and likely to die soon, then realising Mimi is nearby and overheard every word - that part always sends me to tears. The quartet, where Puccini delicately balances between comedy and pathos, jealousy and love, loss and forgiveness, recrimination and hope - always strike me with a sense of wonder how Puccini can juggle all these emotions at once - is perfectly rendered and not overpowering.\n\nAct 4 has to be the most perfect performance ever. The orchestra knows just when to be loud and when to be almost whisper quiet. The timing of singers are impeccable and one can imagine every scene perfectly, with even the swordplay sounding scintillating across the soundstage.\n\nSome critics have complained that Puccini's inclusion of Colline's ode to his coat is disruptive and badly timed, and simply an excuse for a baritone aria. I disagree, Puccini has always been a genius, and he took us to the brink of pathos with the arrival of Musetta, so Colline's aria takes us back from the edge and give us a bit of breathing space before the final assault on the emotions.\n\nKarajan and Ghiaurov implicitly understand this and Colline saying goodbye to his coat is sung in even, calming tones with the orchestra providing a rhythmic and measured accompaniment, rather than for comical effect.\n\nWhen Schaunard and Colline leave, the orchestra picks up just enough for a brief and enchanting prelude before Mimi sings \"Sono andati\" At this point I am usually crying like a baby.\n\nKarajan and the singers demonstrate from here on exactly why this recording is so reknowned and acclaimed. The tempo slows down to a crawl, the characters practically whisper to each other, and it almost feels time, and the universe, has paused. So many stage productions fluff this scene, as the singers feel obliged to project their lines to the whole audience, and often the conductor is impatient as we are nearing the end of the opera.\n\nPavarotti's sense of timing and enunciation is superb. The moment he learns that Mimi has died - the voice changes from hope and optimism, to shock, to despair and grief, accompanied by racking sobs. Karajan chooses this moment, at the closing of the opera, to bring the orchestra to a full crescendo, so our own tears are soothed by a dramatic and sonorous conclusion.","filePath":"src/blog/2023-01-20-la-boheme.md","assetImports":["../images/blog/La Boheme.jpeg","../images/blog/La Boheme (1).jpeg"],"digest":"fd9f6d6d2795d6a5","rendered":{"html":"<p>Guess what I found in Newtown?

I didn't have any bean sprouts or chives, so substituted with lettuce which I like in fried rice anyway. Verdict: surprisingly tasty.\n\n## Recipe for Char Kuay Teow\n\n### Equipment\n\n- Cast iron wok and stirrer\n- Gas cooker\n\n### Ingredients\n\nI used a pre made sauce called\n[Bang Bang Char Kuay Teow sauce](https://www.hengleesauce.com/showproducts/productid/3934979/bang-bang-char-koay-teow-sauce/)\nbut it is also possible to make your own.\n\nSauce (balance to taste):\n\n- dark soy sauce\n- light soy sauce\n- oyster sauce\n- kecap manis (or use sugar)\n\nMain dish:\n\n- Cooked rice, cooled - 1 cup\n- Chinese sausage (lap cheong) - 2 per serve, sliced\n- Fish cake - about 10 thin slices per serve (half a packet)\n- Dried prawns, soaked in warm water and then cut into tiny pieces\n- garlic - about 1-2 cloves, cut into tiny pieces\n- cooking oil - use your judgement, perhaps a few tablespoons\n- chilli paste or sambal belachan - 1 tablespoon or according to taste\n- iceberg lettuce\n\n### Instructions\n\n1. Heat wok on gas cooker.\n2. Add frying oil.\n3. When oil is hot, add garlic, dried prawns, lap cheong, fish cake together more or less at the same time.\n4. Wait for ingredients to be sufficiently cooked (slightly brown), typically after a minute or two. Toss a few times.\n5. Create space at centre of wok by moving ingredients around wok. Break two eggs and toss contents into centre \"hole\". If required, add extra oil.\n6. Break the yolks and stir eggs slightly - no need to batter or mix well. You don't want scrambled egg.\n7. Add salt and pepper to egg.\n8. Before egg has hardened, fold the other ingredients on top of egg, and stir a few times to blend the egg with the other ingredients.\n9. Add chilli paste (and extra oil if necessary). Wait till paste softens and breaks, then stir in other ingredients.\n10. Add rice. Stir a few times until rice breaks into individual grains.\n11. When the dish looks ready (use your judgement based on what you have eaten that you enjoyed) add CKT sauce, stir a few times until sauce is blended in rice.\n12. Turn off heat, add lettuce. The remaining heat will slightly soften the lettuce.\n13.

Thank you my angel - much appreciated.\n\nLa Boheme is of course my favourite opera, and we have experienced multiple productions over the last 40 years, and I own at least half a dozen recordings including the well known ones like the Decca 1959 Serafin version with Renata Tebaldi, the Karajan 1970s recording with Pavarotti/Freni and various others including the Beecham and the one featuring Andrea Bocelli.\n\nHere's a mini review. I also rewatched the\n[Handa production](https://iview.abc.net.au/show/opera-on-sydney-harbour-la-boheme)\nfrom 2019, which is still available on ABC iView.\n\nFirst of all, the positives. The opera is staged in the newly refurbished Joan Sutherland Theatre (formerly the Concert Hall) at the Sydney Opera House. The acoustics are vastly improved using acoustic treatments on the walls and ceilings (the previous Concert Hall was notorious for muddy, boomy sound due to the unique architecture).\n\nThe sets are quite impressive, and quite true to the original setting of the opera (Paris in the 1830s). Definitely better than the rather spartan nature of Baz Luhrmann's famous production in the 1990s, but less big budget and showy compared to the Handa production. All in all I thought they have captured the pre-Haussman Paris (that we all know today) and gave us a reasonable facsimile of Paris during the July Monarchy undergoing industrialisation. The sets referenced the rapid expansion of the outskirts of Paris and the re-fortification of the military wall quite well (Act 3), and Act 2 has a good recreation of the interior of Cafe Momus, although I thought the intrusion of Parpignol into the scene was not well handled. Act 1 and 4, meant to represent the interior of the bohemian's garret, are functional but a bit threadbare. I particularly liked the completed version of Marcello's Red Sea in Act IV which very few productions try to include.\nIncidentally I am super impressed by the Handa production inclusion of the furniture removal scene at the beginning of Act 4, which references the \"missing act\" discovered in 1957 (sorry, but I am a nerd and I like oblique references).\n\nNow, onto the singing and acting. I felt Act 1 was handled reasonably well, but a bit flat. Act 2 had a lot of energy and I think the performers rather enjoyed this act.\n\nActs 3 and 4 are where I feel the performance becomes disappointing. Puccini does an incredible balancing act between comedy and pathos and I think ultimately this is not handled well. Act 3 is meant to be an almost continuous tearjerker, but I didn't cry. The contrast between Rodolfo/Mimi and Marcello/Musetta in the quartet was reasonably well handled (and I particularly liked that Musetta and Marcello made up in the end) but the pacing is wrong and I am not wallowing in the poignancy of Roldolfo and Mimi's pre emptive farewell.\n\nAct 4 is where I am most disappointed. It is missing the first few lines of the libretto. The orchestral preludes segues into Rodolfo and Marcello reminiscing about their ex lovers, and skips the introductory remarks. I don't understand why these lines were skipped. The horseplay between the bohemians feel forced and unnatural, and when Musetta breaks in with the bad news we don't feel the jarring shock that we normally do. Mimi's final aria (Sono andati), surely one of the most moving pieces of music ever written, just feels perfunctory, and Rodolfo just does not cry his heart out enough in the final scene (I want them tears and sobs dammit). Lyn Cheah feels it was rushed through - I am not sure but the pacing is definitely off and I didn't leave the performance emotionally drained but satisfied like I normally do.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02GwSQHuqxXiXtQs3yoKEmM3fHJgr95g9aotaFPw2VMCYLrXtHR4FmywFbcLbp99GNl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"614\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","filePath":"src/blog/2023-01-14-la-boheme.md","assetImports":["../gallery/2023-01-14-la-boheme/DSC01525.jpeg"],"digest":"f6700ee36acdd1c0","rendered":{"html":"<p>Our friend Patricia had 2 tickets to La Boheme and since it is our favourite\nopera, we decided to go.</p>\n<p>Getting there turned out to be quite eventful.

Puccini does an incredible balancing act between comedy and pathos and I think ultimately this is not handled well. Act 3 is meant to be an almost continuous tearjerker, but I didn’t cry. The contrast between Rodolfo/Mimi and Marcello/Musetta in the quartet was reasonably well handled (and I particularly liked that Musetta and Marcello made up in the end) but the pacing is wrong and I am not wallowing in the poignancy of Roldolfo and Mimi’s pre emptive farewell.</p>\n<p>Act 4 is where I am most disappointed. It is missing the first few lines of the libretto. The orchestral preludes segues into Rodolfo and Marcello reminiscing about their ex lovers, and skips the introductory remarks. I don’t understand why these lines were skipped. The horseplay between the bohemians feel forced and unnatural, and when Musetta breaks in with the bad news we don’t feel the jarring shock that we normally do. Mimi’s final aria (Sono andati), surely one of the most moving pieces of music ever written, just feels perfunctory, and Rodolfo just does not cry his heart out enough in the final scene (I want them tears and sobs dammit). Lyn Cheah feels it was rushed through - I am not sure but the pacing is definitely off and I didn’t leave the performance emotionally drained but satisfied like I normally do.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02GwSQHuqxXiXtQs3yoKEmM3fHJgr95g9aotaFPw2VMCYLrXtHR4FmywFbcLbp99GNl&#x26;show_text=true&#x26;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"614\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","metadata":{"headings":[],"imagePaths":[],"frontmatter":{"title":"La Boheme","pubDate":"2023-01-14T12:00:00.000Z","description":"Opera Australia production at the refurbished Joan Sutherland Theatre at the Opera House.","coverImage":"../gallery/2023-01-14-la-boheme/DSC01525.jpeg","gallery":"2023-01-14-la-boheme","categories":["music","event"],"tags":["La Boheme","opera","Sydney Opera House"],"minutesRead":"4 min read","extra":[]}}},"collection":"blog"},{"id":"2023-01-14-rose-bay","data":{"title":"Rose Bay to Watson Bay walk","description":"Temasek Club first activity of the year","pubDate":"2023-01-13T03:00:00.000Z","categories":["event"],"images":[{"src":"/2023/_astro/Temasek Rose Bay walk (6).qvLDWG_z.jpeg","width":2560,"height":1441,"format":"jpg","orientation":1}],"gallery":"2023-01-14-rose-bay","tags":["walk","Temasek club","Rose Bay","Watson Bay"]},"body":"Temasek Club - Sydney Rose Bay to Watson Bay walk.

Do not be tempted to reduce the gas.\n\n## Recipe for Char Kuay Teow\n\n### Equipment\n\n- Cast iron wok and stirrer\n- Gas cooker\n\n### Ingredients\n\nI used a pre made sauce called\n[Bang Bang Char Kuay Teow sauce](https://www.hengleesauce.com/showproducts/productid/3934979/bang-bang-char-koay-teow-sauce/)\nbut it is also possible to make your own.\n\nSauce (balance to taste):\n\n- dark soy sauce\n- light soy sauce\n- oyster sauce\n- kecap manis (or use sugar)\n\nMain dish:\n\n- Flat rice noodles - a handful per serve\n- Chinese sausage (lap cheong) - 1 per serve, sliced\n- Fish cake - about 4-5 thin slices per serve\n- Fresh prawns, deshelled and cleaned - about 2-3 per serve\n- garlic - about 1-2 cloves, cut into tiny pieces\n- cooking oil - use your judgement, perhaps a few tablespoons\n- chilli paste or sambal belachan - 1 tablespoon or according to taste\n- pork \"croutons\" (chee yau char) - essentially deep fried tiny pork fat (I substituted with deep fried crispy pork crackling)\n- fresh bean sprouts, with tails removed - about a handful\n- garlic chives, cut into 1 inch pieces - about a handful\n\n### Instructions\n\n1. Heat wok on gas cooker.\n2. Add frying oil.\n3. When oil is hot, add garlic, prawns, lap cheong, fish cake together more or less at the same time.\n4. When above is sufficiently cooked (slightly brown), typically only a few seconds, add noodles.\n5. Wait for noodles to get slightly brown, then add chilli paste.\n6. Create space at centre of wok by moving ingredients around wok. Break an egg and toss contents into centre \"hole\". If required, add extra oil.\n7. Break the yolk and stir egg slightly - no need to batter or mix well. You don't want scrambled egg.\n8. Before egg has hardened, fold the noodles and other ingredients on top of egg, and stir a few times to blend the egg with the other ingredients.\n9. Avoid over stirring or blending - this breaks the noodles too much and the dish is meant to look rustic.\n10. When the dish looks ready (use your judgement based on what you have eaten that you enjoyed) add sauce, stir a few times until sauce is blended in.\n11. Turn off heat, add bean sprouts and chives. The remaining heat will gradually cook these ingredients.\n12. Before the bean sprouts and chives have cooked completely, remove from wok and plate up.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02PfRnHe19jjYXtYiQVMS31LkdHiiYyuy4PxKxjSgVgw2NAbSiY7Y2TgiewaBccRCMl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"781\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>","filePath":"src/blog/2023-01-09-char-kuay-teow.md","assetImports":["../images/food/Char Kuay Teow.jpeg"],"digest":"f994fae3f8264b99","rendered":{"html":"<p>I bought my portable gas cooker and wok set last year, intending to cook the famous Malaysian dish Char Kuay Teow on it, but for various reasons never really got around to it.
