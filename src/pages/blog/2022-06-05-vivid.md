This year Vivid Sydney #vividsydney goes to Taronga Zoo Sydney. We are too cheapskate to pay money for the tickets, so we just viewed it from the outside. Still fun and vibrant!

Vivid Sydney #vividsydney has resurrected Carriageworks as a venue. Love the vibe here - atmospherically creepy.

Internationally celebrated light artist Sam Whiteside will take over the entrance of Carriageworks with his free, immersive lighting installation titled 'contact'. This large-scale, monolithic lightwork draws visitors through a dense haze and an intense column of shifting light.

'contact' uses algorithmically generated simulations and intense shafts of light that pulse throughout the space, allowing visitors to navigate an ever-shifting distorted reality set to a multi-array drone soundscape composed and produced by Patrick Liney.
