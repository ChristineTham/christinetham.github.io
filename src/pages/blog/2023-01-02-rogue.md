Nerd achievement for 2023 - finally managed to get Rogomatic working. I used to play the Unix computer game rogue when I was in uni in the 1980s, but was never good at it - I always get killed before Level 20. I am now too old to ever master it, so Rogomatic plays my games for me.

Top 10 rogue scores after playing more than 2000 games using rogomatic - still haven't retrieved the Amulet of Yendor:

Top Ten Scores:
   Score Name
 1  5856 Rog-O-Matic XIV for christie: killed on level 20 by a phantom.
 2  4898 Rog-O-Matic XIV for christie: killed on level 21 by a jabberwock.
 3  4841 Rog-O-Matic XIV for christie: killed on level 20 by a medusa.
 4  4490 Rog-O-Matic XIV for christie: killed on level 18 by starvation.
 5  4444 Rog-O-Matic XIV for christie: killed on level 17 by a xeroc.
 6  4319 Rog-O-Matic XIV for christie: killed on level 17 by a troll.
 7  4197 Rog-O-Matic XIV for christie: killed on level 16 by a troll.
