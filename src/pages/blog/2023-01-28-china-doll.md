Amazing dinner at China Doll restaurant. Thank you to Patricia Yong for organising! I've always wanted to try this place, because I have seen cooking shows featuring Frank Shek the head chef. Well, the food did not disappoint - probably one of the best meals I've had in recent times.

Even though the food is labelled Modern Asian Fusion, none of the dishes are gimmicky - all came across as genuinely well cooked dishes full of flavour. Although each dish appear to be based on a well known classic dish, the addition of unusual and cross cultural ingredients make the dish special. There was so much food we simply could not finish it all and it was a fantastic night chatting away with great company!

Post dinner we had cocktails (and mocktails) at the beautifully decorated Alibi Sydney at Ovolo Woolloomooloo. After that we walked along Finger Wharf and the Sydney skyline is just so beautiful, with Centrepoint shining like a lighthouse with a slight mist.
