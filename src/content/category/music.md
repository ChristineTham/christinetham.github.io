description: I love listening, playing and composing music.

My interests in music are broad, ranging from classical, jazz, contemporary to modern. My favourite composer of all time is probably Johann Sebastian Bach, but I also like many of the other classical composers. I listen to mostly Puccini and Wagner operas. In terms of jazz, I love Pat Metheny and Keith Jarrett. I also love electronic music, particularly Vangelis, Tangerine Dream and Jean Michel Jarre. My favourite minimalist composers are Brian Eno, Philip Glass, Steve Reich and John Adams. I listen to range of modern artists including Mike Oldfield, Pet Shop Boys, Madonna, Phil Collins. I also like playing the piano and guitar, and composing music, which I do in my own studio complete with mixing and monitoring consoles, digital audio workstation, and various instruments including a stage piano. I am also obsessed with synthesizers ever since I heard the music of Vangelis on the Cosmos TV series. I currently own a Kawai stage piano, several MIDI controllers (NI Komplete Kontrol A25 and S88MkII) and Maschine 3. I also own various virtual instruments (NI Komplete Ultimate, EastWest, SonicCouture, Sonokinetic, Korg, Roland, UVI). My favourite notation software are Notion and Finale, and I use Logic Pro X as my DAW.
