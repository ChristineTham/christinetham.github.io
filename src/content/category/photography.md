I started taking photos in high school using my father's Yashica rangefinder. I had a series of Pentax SLR bodies and a variety of lenses. With digital photography, I bought a Kodak DC220 in 1999 and currently uses a variety of brands including Sony (α9, α7r, α6500, NEX-F3, NEX-5N, RX100MkIV, HS50V), Leica (M10), Panasonic (GX9), Nikon 1 (J5, V3, V2, J1) and Pentax (K-01).
