Braving Time is a queer exhibition that celebrates the work of artists who identify as part of the Australian LGBTQIA+ community. This significant exhibition has been curated by Richard Perram OAM for the National Art School in celebration of Sydney WorldPride in 2023.

The artists represented in the exhibition celebrate the diverse voices of LGBTQIA+ people in contemporary Australia society, reflecting the breath of genders and sexualities within the community, including artists who identify as lesbian, gay, transgender, inter-sex, asexual and non-binary.

The artists present artworks that explore queerness in ways that are direct and indirect through historical and contemporary artworks that are critical, experimental and political, connecting to our contemporary culture. Together these works instigate conversations about queer experience; what it is and what it means to be queer in Australia today.

The Australian LGBTQIA+ community naturally reflects the cultural diversity of Australian contemporary society and this is mirrored in the artists selected. Central to the exhibition are works by Australian Indigenous artists Karla Dickens and Tony Albert. Artists from diverse cultural heritages include William Yang and Renjie Teoh, Claudia Nicholson, Salote Tawale, Ramesh Mario Nithiyendran sitting alongside artists of Anglo-European heritage.

The key themes and connections that flow and overlap through this exhibition are rich and complex and represent issues that have been and remain central, to LGBTQIA+ lived experience including Our Queer Ancestors, Queer Worthies, Death and History, Feminist Expression, Family and Community, Maleness and Power, Humour, Gender and Sexuality.

Together the artists in Braving Time acknowledge the many struggles, the deep sadnesses as well as the triumphs of Australia’s LGBTQIA+ communities over time. The exhibition highlights that queerness is intersectional and it creates parallel conversations about the new histories that are emerging and leading debate, whilst capturing the optimism of change, of acceptance and the pure joy that will be felt by all during the Sydney WorldPride celebrations in 2023.
