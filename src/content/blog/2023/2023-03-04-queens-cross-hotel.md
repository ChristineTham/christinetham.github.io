The iconic Kings Cross Hotel transforms itself into the Queens Cross Hotel for World Pride. It is the Pride Party Palace with floors called Pride Pub, Pink Patio, Diamond Disco, Passion Parlour and Rainbow Rooftop.

In the heart of the city’s most renowned nightlife precinct, the Kings Cross Hotel is a Sydney institution and an enduring icon. Bridging the divide between the Kings Cross of old and the evolving face of the ‘New’ Cross, the KXH remains firmly committed to bringing on the Good Times. Six floors of diverse spaces, the area’s best rooftop bar and an eclectic roster of live entertainment make Kings Cross Hotel Sydney both a laidback local hang-out and the city’s premier party destination – a level of choice for every taste, mood and day of the week. Steeped in history and legend, the legacy of the Cross lives on at the Kings Cross Hotel.

For the 4th year running, Kings Cross Hotel will transform into the iconic Queens Cross Hotel for 19 days of entertainment during Sydney WorldPride 2023 in proud partnership with the team from 4the.love, who will be transforming Queens Cross into 5 levels of unity, celebration, and glittering love. Each level will highlight its own identity, from the pride pub to the rainbow rendezvous rooftop.
