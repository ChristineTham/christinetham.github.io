Finally had a chance to try Authentic KL Flavors in Marrickville that everyone has been talking about. Serves typical Malay food including nasi kerabu, nasi berluak, and today's special is nasi dagang. All in all we had a good time, and met a couple and their baby on the next table who had lived in Singapore. Good opportunity to catch up with everyone!
