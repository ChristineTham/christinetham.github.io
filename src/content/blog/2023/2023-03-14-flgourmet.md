F & L Gourmet is a hallowed institution of Chinese dining at Macquarie Centre for almost as long as I have been in Sydney. I remember visiting them in the 1990s when I was working nearby. They used to be a cheap and cheerful place, but in their new(ish) location the decor is considerably improved. I wouldn't at all be surprised if some of the staff were working in the 1990s because they seemed to recognise me when I walked in and treated me like the long standing customer that I am. Having lunch here with Cat Bowrey and Margaret Stow - the best dish of the day was actually the black truffle fried rice but I forgot to take a photo so you'll just have to imagine how good it looks.
