Fantastic dinner at the exclusive and hard to get into Mr. Fat Duck Peking Restaurant. Wow, the food here is as good as everyone says - the twice cooked tea smoked duck is to die for, as well as Mariel Jw FbTime's favourite the Chun Kong pork rib belly. The jelly fish was perfect, and my personal favourite is the tea smoked vegetarian bean curd rolls. Other dishes we tried included XO sauce cod, salted duck egg soft shell crab and ma po tofu. So much food we couldn't finish any of the dishes!
