We decided on the spur of the moment to visit Guildford to try out the new
satay stall (the previous satay stall operated by Samad Chong has moved elsewhere).

We arrived on Saturday just before 6pm and was surprised at how busy and popular
the place was. The queue stretched all the way to the street!
