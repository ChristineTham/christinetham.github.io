Continuing my series of unconventional burgers, this is a an open burger made using bakkwa as the "meat" coupled with traditional Aussie toppings such as cucumber, tomato, lettuce, beetroot and pineapple. On top, I have added a flourish of pork floss and fried shallots. To complete the fusion experience, this should probably be served with kerupuk but I decided the burger is enough. Verdict: the burgers are NOT better at Hungry Jacks.
