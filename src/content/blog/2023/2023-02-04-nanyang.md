Amazing Lunar New Year lunch at Nan Yang Tea Club curated and hosted by Adeline Lamond. The dishes were spectacular - I especially loved the steamed murray cod and XO mud crab, and was so full afterwards I could hardly have any of the remaining dishes. Thank you to the staff for cooking and presenting this huge feast. It was also a great opportunity to meet a variety of new and established friends and to be able to enjoy such a meal together.
