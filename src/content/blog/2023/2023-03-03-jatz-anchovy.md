Trying a new recipe - this is my version of Jatz biscuits with anchovy, roasted seaweed, yuzu mayonaise sauce and roasted sesame. Wonder if I can charge A$20 for 4?
Verdict: the flavour profile is good, but a bit salty. I need to either halve the anchovy amount, or find a less salty version.
Anyone has any tips on desalting anchovies or a good less salty brand?
