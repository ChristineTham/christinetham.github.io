AWS Summit this year is back to being an in person event, so it was good to visit it and see life returning to normal.

I am not currently a user of AWS, but I have previously used it in my consulting life. I was interested to know what's new. By chance I met two people I know and we had a great time in the post conference drinks. I also captured photos around Chinatown at night after the conference.
