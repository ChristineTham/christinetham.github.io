Last year the Gotong Royong Girls embarked on our first project - making bakkwa (also called loong yoke in Cantonese) and kuih kapit (love letters) for Lunar New Year. To be honest, I think we under estimated how much effort and skill were required. This year, we are better prepared and started earlier.

We were so efficient we completed rolling and BBQing the bakkwa before lunch. The kuih kapit still required a long time to make, but we made a lot more than last year (conservatively at least 3X the quantity).

Even so, we did not finish until 9pm and everyone was exhausted at the end of the day.
