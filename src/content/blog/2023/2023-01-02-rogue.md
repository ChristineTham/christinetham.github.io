Nerd achievement for 2023 - finally managed to get Rogomatic working. I used to play the Unix computer game rogue when I was in uni in the 1980s, but was never good at it - I always get killed before Level 20. I am now too old to ever master it, so Rogomatic plays my games for me.

Top 10 rogue scores after playing more than 2000 games using rogomatic - still haven't retrieved the Amulet of Yendor:

Top Ten Scores:

1 5856 Rog-O-Matic XIV for christie: killed on level 20 by a phantom.
2 4898 Rog-O-Matic XIV for christie: killed on level 21 by a jabberwock.
3 4841 Rog-O-Matic XIV for christie: killed on level 20 by a medusa.
4 4490 Rog-O-Matic XIV for christie: killed on level 18 by starvation.
