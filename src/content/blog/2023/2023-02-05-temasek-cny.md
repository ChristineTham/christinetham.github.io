This is the Lunar New Year 15th day (Chap Goh Mei) celebration dinner organised by the Temasek Club - Sydney at the Palace Chinese Restaurant. Fun time with a delicious 8 course menu plus desserts, and a riotous night with lots of yum sengs, lucky draw prizes and lion dance! I was too busy flitting around like a butterfly that I couldn't take some of the food photos in time and can only capture morsels.
