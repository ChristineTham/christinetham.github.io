Surprise birthday lunch for Ee-Vonne Loke organised by Kathleen Pong at Wai's Kitchen. I have never been to this restaurant before, and the food is really good - I have not tried many of these dishes (glutinous fried rice, hand pulled noodles etc.) but they were all good. The pork and century egg congee with yau tiu is flavoursome.
