A short ride today. Another rider had an accident involving a car descending into Northbridge. He's been taken to hospital, suspected broken collarbone. Luckily I was at the back of the bunch and slowed down well ahead of time, but saw everything. After that I didn't want to ride anymore, so I went back by myself via Pacific Highway.
