Temasek Club - Sydney historic walk around Kings Cross and Potts Point, organised by Karen Ong. Even though I have lived in Sydney for over 40 years, this area is still relatively unknown to me so I felt like a tourist in my own city.

Afterwards we had lunch at Bang Tang Salad 'n Rolls. The food was good but the portions were a bit small, however the service was excellent given there were so many of us.
