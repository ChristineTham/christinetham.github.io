There is a hidden secret in Chatswood - an authentic izakaya tucked away on the upper floor of a nondescript building on a quiet street away from the hustle and bustle. Called Izakaya Nakano, it's a very small place with only a few tables and the clientele is mostly Japanese. We felt like we could have been in Tokyo and spent the night nibbling at the various plates and drinking sake. Even though the serving sizes are very small, we felt full and actually could not finish the dishes, so there is definitely some magic happening here.
