Run, do not walk, do not pass Go, to Nanyang Tea Club and have their delicious Seafood Feast (details can be found on their web site: https://www.nanyanghome.com.au/.../australian-seafood-feast). We went there, and the three of us could not finish it! Serving size was very generous and high quality, plus delicious! Plus the service was excellent, and there is nothing like eating off the table with the food served on banana leaves.
