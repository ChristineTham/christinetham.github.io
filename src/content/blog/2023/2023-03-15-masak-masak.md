Masak masak at Adeline Lamond's house. Amazing dishes from amazing women, some of which I have never seen before including Swit choi for ngup si tong mai by Lynn Lee, chicken, lap cheong and mushroom po chai fan by Karen Lim, deluxe poon choy by Sharon Whitney, and soup buntut by Eemie Ong. I also contributed my experimental anchovy and mushroom canapes, plus we finished off with an orange sponge cake by Aileen Lim and a fruit platter from Eunice Fong. Oh, and delicious kimchee dumplings from Adeline and bakkwa from Cheng Lim.
