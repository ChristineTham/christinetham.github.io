Delicious lunch at Porkfat Sydney followed by amazing desserts at Mango CoCo Thai Dessert Cafe Sydney. Thank you to Cat Bowrey for organising and collaging the photos. It was great experiencing superlative Thai food in Sydney. I first discovered Thai food in the early 90s and immediately fell in love with it. I think I must have been Thai in my past life.
