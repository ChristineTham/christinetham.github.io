Happy birthday to gorgeous Karen Lim and celebrating with a Japanese theme dinner at Nakano Darling. We had some pre-dinner drinks at Charlie Chan. We had a great time eating a variety of Japanese food in a private room that somehow miraculously fitted all of us in! Sharon Wong baked a delicious array of cakes including lapis Surabaya, butter cupcakes and lemon drizzle. Thank you to Lyn Cheah for co-organising, Margaret Stow for organising the hand made birthday card, and Cat Bowrey for supplying the birthday present.
