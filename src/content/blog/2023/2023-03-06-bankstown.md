Lunch at Huong Xua Bankstown - amazing feast curated by Adeline Lamond with James, the owner. We had prawn and pork salad, snails, mussels, chicken, spring rolls, grilled pork and chicken and bamboo shoot pho. We even had a few extra dishes delivered to our table that we gobbled up anyway. The snails are interesting - we were given gloves and sticks to remove them from the shells. I normally control myself during meals but the food was so delicious I went into full piggy mode and had to waddle out of the restaurant - so satisfying.

After that, we had some drinks at the nearby Bankstown Sports club - they were delicious! Dragonfruit and lychee!
