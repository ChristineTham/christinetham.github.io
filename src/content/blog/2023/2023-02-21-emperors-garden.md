Sometimes, even when things don't go according to plan, they work out for the best. We were all looking forward to eating at the new Golden Century BBQ at Darling Square, only to discover they are closed on Tuesdays. So we all headed to Emperor's Garden BBQ & Noodles and promptly ordered a storm of dishes. Roast suckling pig, roast duck, BBQ pork, gelatinous cold platter, wonton, chicken and salted fish fried rice, ginger infused kai lan, seafood hot pot. There was so much food, all delicious, and so much laughter and happy conversations. Best of all was being called "leng lui" by the waitress! Afterwards, we shopped at Thai Kee IGA and had air mata kuching and ais kachang at Ho Jiak Haymarket. All in all a great day!
