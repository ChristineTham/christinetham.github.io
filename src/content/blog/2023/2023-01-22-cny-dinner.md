Lunar New Year dinner hosted by Sharon Wong and Auntie Kim. Sharon is famous for her amazing yee sang loh hei which I was privileged enough to experience last year and this year she went even further and it's the biggest plate I have ever seen with luxe ingredients.

Also on the menu are loh hon chai (Buddha's delight), 8 treasure rice, Mille Feuilles Napa Cabbage, XO prawn noodles, Aileen Lim's orange/mandarin chiffon cake, prawn dumplings, and delightful koi fish jelly which we helped make (and the technique is an eye opener!).

Lunar New Year is best celebrated with family and friends, and it reminds us that at the end of the day, its the ones we love that will bring us the most happiness and joy, much more than fame and fortune.
