Ho Jiak Strathfield has revamped their menu and kitchen, so Lynn Lee and I decided to give it a try. The salt and pepper fried tofu skins were delicious (recommendation from Adeline Lamond and Eemie Ong). The char kuay teow cannot be faulted. And we also tried sam dan wong, the classic Cantonese three egg dish that is notoriously difficult to cook perfectly. I suspected they were having problems cooking this in the kitchen, as the dish took a long time to come and the girl at the counter apologised for the delay. Finally, she said the kitchen cannot cook it to the required level of quality and decided to refund us the money. They served the dish to us anyway because we said we were happy to try it. To my Chrissilicious taste buds it was great - perfect tasting. A bit on the runny side, but that is so much better than overcooking it. I gave full marks to the kitchen team and they were pleased.
