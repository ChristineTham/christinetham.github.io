Attending an Axi trading market outlook seminar, invited by Luci Peranakan. Wow, I did not expect to be served food catered by Justin from Nanyang Tea Club. The satay and chicken curry were delicious, and the CKT surprisingly tasty. Also met a few friends from Temasek Club - Sydney here - Jing Lou and Adrienne Abidin amongst others. The view from here is absolutely fantastic, and learnt a lot from the seminar and met new people!
