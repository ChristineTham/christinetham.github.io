Every now and then Sydney goes completely crazy. This is the 24 hour
[Mopoke Sydney festival](https://mopokesydney.com.au/) featuring an open air cinema, open museums and buildings, food trucks, a fire show and a silent disco amongst other things. I wandered around feeling bemused.

Attractions include dark light installations, museums, art, food and wine.
