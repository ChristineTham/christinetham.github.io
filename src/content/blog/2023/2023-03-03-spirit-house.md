This is Spirit House by Lee Mingwei at the new building of Art Gallery of New South Wales. It invites us to consider our future journey. I want to take this moment to reflect on my journey in recent years, in particular my health.
When I retired a few years ago at age 55, I was aging rapidly, fat and unhealthy. My hair was thinning and falling out, I no longer have perfect vision, my BMI was slightly over 25 (obese), I had stopped cycling for several years. I had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, a fatty liver, high iron, and I was turning into a diabetic.
In the last year and a half, I have lost 12 kg, and started cycling again. In my last medical checkup, my doctor gave me a clean bill of health. My blood results and vital signs are all good, and I have the metabolism of a thirty something year old. I never realised the health benefits of weight loss can be so dramatic.
In this photo, you are seeing the natural me. I don't have any hair colour and am not wearing makeup. I've never taken botox, fillers or hormones. My body has never been surgically changed or enhanced. Yes, I would like certain bits to be bigger and other bits smaller, but at this point in my life I accept my body - even the bits that have broken and mended (my collarbone and various fingers).
I will be turning 60 next year and accessing my superannuation and applying for my Seniors Card. I am looking forward to the years ahead.
