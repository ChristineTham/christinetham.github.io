Cycling today: nearly missed the ride, I was late. But I did well today, no cramps, no bonks, I took it really easy on the climb and was strong all the way to the end. I treated myself to a 2nd breakfast of bacon and egg roll with hash brown, plus a mango smoothie. No guilt, since I burnt a day's worth of calories.

From today's cycling - my favourite bit of Mona Vale Rd. Today was a slow day, we sometimes average 40 km/h+ here ...
