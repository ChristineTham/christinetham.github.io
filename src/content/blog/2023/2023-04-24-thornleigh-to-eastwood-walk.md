Almost 11km walk from Thornleigh to Eastwood via the Great North Walk. We crossed so many streams, some of which would have been dry but there's been a lot of rain recently. At one point, the track was a stream! We also saw many mushrooms, and in some cases so many it was a mushroom forest! Fortunately, the weather was dry but started drizzling when we reached Eastwood. We were so hungry we devoured lunch at Hong Kong Recipe
