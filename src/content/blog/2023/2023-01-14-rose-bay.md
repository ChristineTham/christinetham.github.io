Temasek Club - Sydney Rose Bay to Watson Bay walk. At first we were wondering whether we should cancel, as it was raining at Circular Quay where we gathered. We decided to go for it, and thank goodness the rain mostly stayed away except for a brief angry burst. We stopped by briefly at Vaucluse House. Over 50 people signed up for the walk, and we really enjoyed it, as well as lunch afterwards at Doyle's.
