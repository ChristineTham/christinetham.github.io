We have been residents (and ratepayers) of Willoughby City Council for over 20 years, and one of the reasons we moved in was Willoughby had its own Willoughby Symphony and concert hall. However, for various reasons, we've never attended any of their concerts, until now. Had a great night listening to various film themes (Heroes of Hollywood) and the conductor was very pleased I gave them a standing ovation. Will definitely attend more concerts in the future - I love the "sound" of the orchestra, and the excellent acoustics of the The Concourse Chatswood concert hall - reminds me of the Barbican in London (similar size and reverb characteristics) which is a world class performance and recording venue.
