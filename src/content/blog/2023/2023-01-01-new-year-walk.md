We have an annual tradition of doing a walk around Sydney on New Year's day.
It is interesting to see a fresh look on the city after the festivities the
night before.

This year, we started from Milson's Point, walked the Harbour Bridge from Kirribilli
then across Observatory Hill to walk on the Barangaroo foreshore and ended up
having lunch at Chinatown.
