Lunch at Eastwood at Hukuya Sushibar, followed by second lunch at 香港冰室 Hong Kong Bing Sutt. For once, I was so greedy and hungry I devoured the food before I remembered to take photos. So the only photos I have is of the boat sashimi and sushi (we also had soba, soft shell crab roll and various other sushi) and the salted egg chicken wings.
