Macon Reed’s Eulogy for the Dyke Bar is presented by the National Art School with UNSW Galleries in association with Sydney WorldPride.

American artist Macon Reed creates immersive sculptural environments that serve as sites for conversation and exchange. Eulogy for the Dyke Bar revisits the legacy and physical spaces of dyke and lesbian bars, an increasingly rare component of the gay and queer cultural landscape.

Made of simple materials that unapologetically reveal the hand in their making, the work is activated through its use as a fully functional bar and space for public programs.

Eulogy for the Dyke Bar uses the reclaimed term ‘dyke’ in its most expansive sense and recognises that gender and identities are complex and fluid. If you have identified with the term or an experience of feminine-spectrum queerness in the past or present (or perhaps future), and/or feel an affiliation or ally-ship with dyke culture, you are welcome, and valued at the dyke bar.

I am immediately comfortable with the pink theme, and the names of the drinks sound interesting.
