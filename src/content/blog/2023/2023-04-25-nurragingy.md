Early autumn at Nurrangingy Chang Lai Gardens on ANZAC Day. Still a bit too early for the autumn leaves, but it was a pleasant day to be out taking a stroll around the lakes.

Some people say the ibis is ugly and, like the pigeon, can be an urban pest because it is a scavenger. I think it is a beautiful and graceful bird, almost mythical in its look. I took some photos at the lake near Chang Lai gardens, Nurragingy Reserve.
