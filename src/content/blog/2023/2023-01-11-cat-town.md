Post Xmas and Hello New Year lunch at Cat town featuring some amazing dishes cooked by Cat Bowrey - including crab fried rice, BBQ sotong, salted chargrilled red emperor fish, salted egg salad, pomelo salad, salted egg and fish ball green curry with eggplant, and finishing off with Margaret Stow's sticky date pudding. Nothing like a great afternoon eating, drinking and talking about everything under the sun.
