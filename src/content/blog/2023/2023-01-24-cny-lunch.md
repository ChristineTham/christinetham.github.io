Chinese New Year lunch at XOPP by Golden Century. This is the first time I have been to the restaurant, and the food was great! We explored some alternative dishes as some of their CNY special menu items were no longer available - must have been popular!

Of course, we had the signature dish (XO pipis) but I also liked the Typhoon Shelter Cauliflower and the steamed barramundi.

After that, we were so full but still found enough room to order not just one but EVERY dessert dish on the menu at Holy Basil - Haymarket.
