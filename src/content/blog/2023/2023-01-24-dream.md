Weird dream: I am sitting for an exam, but running late getting there. Inexplicably, i decided to make it even later by stopping by to have lunch on the way. So by the time I reached the exam hall, I was over an hour late. The examiners were furious with me.

The exam is more like a capstone project. There are 12 questions, I only need to choose one to answer. But it's a complex question, involving analysing lots of data, formulating a theory and presenting conclusions in a report. I further made things worse by going meta and decided to waste valuable time determining which question to answer by analysing the questions itself. I was going to answer the question which was most ethical, has the largest relevance to world peace and one that no one else was attempting.

I started having an argument with the examiners who thought I was completely over the top.

Anyway the question I eventually chose requires all sorts of data which I found difficulty obtaining, including the median price of shoes of a certain brand in New York City in a particular year. I complained to the examiners that they need to help me obtain this data.

So, basically, I am Karen from Facebook.
