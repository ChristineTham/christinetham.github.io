Lunch at Cat Bowrey's house where we enjoyed very delicious dishes, including chicken wings, mieng kham, larb glass noodles with pork and prawn, eggplant omelette, pork and fish, plus Jennifer Hicks for supplying the delicious fruit platter and Aileen Lim for the chiffon cake. Plus Cat cooked the pork lard that we will use for cooking Malaysian style dishes.
