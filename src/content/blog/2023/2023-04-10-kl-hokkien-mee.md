Cooking KL fried hokkien mee with fish cake and fish balls. The all important ingredients are of course the pork lard and pork croutons, but flounder powder and chicken stock are also essential. My first attempt was a failure - I tried following a recipe, and ended up with a dish that was over seasoned. I learnt to trust my instincts and add just enough of each ingredient until I feel it is enough. I also added a bit of cornflour at the end to thicken the sauce - I find otherwise the sauce never gets thick enough to my satisfaction and I like the noodles al dente.

Ingredients:

- hokkien mee, around 250g per serving
- fish cake, several slices
- 3 fish balls, cut in half
- choi sum, 1 stalk
- garlic, diced
- black caramel cooking sauce
- flounder powder
- chicken stock
- white pepper
- small amount of cornflour mixed in a little water
- pork lard
- chee yaw char (pork croutons)

Instructions:

1. Heat wok, add pork lard
2. Add garlic, fish cake, fish balls
3. Add hokkien mee
4. Add chicken stock, black caramel cooking sauce, flounder powder, white pepper
5. When noodles appear cooked (soft), add choi sum
6. When dish is ready, turn off heat, add pork croutons, and serve.
