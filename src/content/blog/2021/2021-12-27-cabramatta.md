Fantastic day shopping in Cabramatta with Cat Bowrey and Jennifer Hicks. It's as fun as going on an overseas trip, and Cat was an excellent tour guide. We had a delightful lunch at Pho Anna - the owner came and chatted with us, and was genuinely surprised when I gave him a tip. I bought loads of stuff including the lychees (pictured yesterday) and a box of R2E2 mangoes - these are so huge I am calling them "Amy Yip" mangoes.

Nearly 2kg of lychees - ok they didn't come in a fancy box, but I didn't pay $100 either - still sweet and juicy.
