Today I was cycling around Parramatta Park, and I decided to do a hot lap, and I zoomed past this cyclist up the hill. He decided to give chase, and by the fact he caught up almost instantaneously and effortlessly, I knew he was a much better cyclist than me, possibly pro or semi pro grade (I was going uphill at the speed limit of 30 km/h).

He said he had a tough training session yesterday, and today was supposed to be a recovery ride, but when he saw me he couldn't resist the chase.

He invited me to tuck in behind him, but there was no way I could maintain his pace, so he slowed down and allowed me to catch up to him.

He invited me to "lead him out" (cycling jargon for "cycle as hard as you can and I'll follow you"). I think he was just interested to know what my limit was.

I think I gave him a good performance, but I was also careful not to go into oxygen debt because that's a rookie mistake.

I wish I knew who he was. I could potentially have asked for an autograph.
