In a vain effort to shake off all the food from recent feasts, we went to Scenic World Blue Mountains, took the Skyway cable car and viewed the spectacular Katoomba Falls, Blue Mountains. After that we went on foot and walked from the top of the falls to the base via Furber Steps.

The falls were amazing because of recent rain, but the ground was very muddy so it was a good opportunity to give the trail shoes a good workout.
