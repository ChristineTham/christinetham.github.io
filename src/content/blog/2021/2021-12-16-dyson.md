Dyson is almost as evil as Apple in terms of repairability - the Cinetic Big Ball vacuum is advertised as "No dirty filters to wash or replace" but ours started to smell so the filter needs replacing. Took a bit of searching to figure out how to order the filter (Dyson Australia doesn't sell it) and then how to dismantle the machine (tip: need a long necked Torx T15 screwdriver which are surprisingly difficult to source). But finally done.
