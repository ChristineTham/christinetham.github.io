The simplest possible fried rice - the only seasoning is salt and pepper, no soy sauce, no fish sauce. Surprisingly delicious, allows the aromats and the taste of the ingredients to shine through. The secret is cooking each ingredient separately and then combining everything at the end. Substitute your own meat and vegetables.
