Weird dream: I am at a girls' night out with some friends, and it was getting late, so we were preparing to go home. A friend said she was going to stop by at the library, and I exclaimed "Surely it is closed by now!" but she said she checked and the library doesn't close until 10pm.

Next thing I know, I am sleeping in bed. I have no memory of how I got home. Just as I was stirring in my sleep, I felt a man's hand touch my arm.

I had a big shock, until I realised I am sleeping at a friend's place because he was overseas. Perhaps he has returned early and decided to sleep in his bed next to me.

Then I thought "Am I decent?" I quickly checked, and I think I am wearing some sort of satiny nightie with stringy straps.

The man got out of bed. I decided to pull the quilt over my head because I am guessing my hair is a mess. I felt the man tuck me in.
