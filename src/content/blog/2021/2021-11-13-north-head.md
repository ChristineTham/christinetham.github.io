Ride to North Head yesterday - disappointed that my extra strength from HI interval training wasn't as extensive or long lasting as I had hoped. My early morning sprint down Pacific Highway did show that I am now able to reach 40+ km/h, but I climbed up to Battle Boulevard at a mediocre 15 km/h rather than the 18 I was hoping for. On the way back, I started the Parriwi Rd climb at a respectable 18, but dwindled down to 16 by the time I reached the top. I am still quite tired at the end - not convinced I am up for a 70+ km ride.
