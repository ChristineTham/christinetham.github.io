I was really pleased when they arrived, but my goodness the tyres are impossible to fit, the clinchers are so tight (no smutty smirks, please). In the end I took them to the bike shop and it took two men and a tyre fitting tool to put them on. I went for a ride on Tue, and within 15 mins the rear tyre popped off the rim so had to return to the bike shop. Today I went for a ride in between rain and luckily the tyres seem okay so fingers crossed for future rides.
