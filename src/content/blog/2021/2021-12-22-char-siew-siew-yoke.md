Too scared to eat out because of Omicron. Bought some char siew and siew yoke (unsliced) from the Chinese BBQ place on the ground floor of Castle Mall that everyone has been recommending. After a few minutes in the convection oven (I refuse to call it an "airfryer" what a wanky name) I sliced them. I think I need a sharper knife.
