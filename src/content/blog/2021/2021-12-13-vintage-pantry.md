Amazing Ladies Xmas Lunch at The Vintage Pantry Secret Garden organised by Cat Bowrey. So much laughter and fun and delightful Xmas presents in the company of an amazing group of ladies.

Tip for anyone visiting this place: the eponymously named dessert (The Secret Garden) is an absolute must have - I will definitely order this next time I am here.
