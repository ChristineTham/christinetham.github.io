This is the second movement from J S Bach's arrangement of Alessandro Marcello's Oboe Concerto BWV 974 (BC L194). It is not often performed, but after hearing Glenn Gould's amazing rendition of it, I had to learn how to play it. I didn't rely on the metronome as i wanted the freedom of varying the tempo, but I visually aligned to the target tempo at the start so the first 10 bars or so are pretty on the beat, after that ... Recorded using a Kawai MP10. The piano sound is a virtual Yamaha grand recorded at EastWest studios, with reverb based on QL Spaces (San Francisco Hall) and iZotope Ozone 8 mastering.
