Wow, what a dream: I am participating in a Masterchef-like cooking competition. We have to uplift and "fix" a mediocre dish, and unfortunately whilst I had lots of ideas (including using sesame and black beans), I didn't make a lot of progress, because I spent most of my allotted time crying. I discovered another competitor (a very young boy barely out of his teens) has some sort of weird but serious illness and may have to leave the competition. For some weird reason, they had a segment on the show ranking the top Asian competitors and I was nowhere near the top 3.
