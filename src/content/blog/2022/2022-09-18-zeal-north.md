My first 68km ride (with Kymbal and Michael from Zeal of Zebras) in over 5 years, burning 1723 calories, going to Church Point and back via Northern Beaches and Terrey Hills. My new mantra is to never exceed my max heart rate, as a result I am a lot slower than normal but at least I didn't cramp. Our ride overlapped the Bobbin Head Cycle Classic at one point, and we waved to all the ride marshals. After that, a well deserved cappuccino and bacon egg roll with sweet chilli sauce at Dose.
