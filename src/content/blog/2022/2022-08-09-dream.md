Yesterday's dream is a prequel to my dream the night before. I am at a hotel packing my suitcase before a flight. I am having difficulties fitting everything in, so decided to do a full clean out and remove anything that I don't need. To my amazement, I found a lot of stuff from previous trips that I forgot to unpack. Including multiple camera film rolls - processed and unprocessed. I also saw prints from the photo lab that I haven't had time to look at before. In the middle of sorting all the mess, the housecleaner opened the room door, because I forgot to put a "do not disturb" sign on the door, saw my mess, and discreetly decided to come back later. I was panicking and trying to cover myself with a towel, because I was only wearing undies. Later on the housecleaner came back with her friends, and they were all admiring the amount of junk I have. I am still only wearing my undies.
