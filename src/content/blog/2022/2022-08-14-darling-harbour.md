Wandering around the Darling Harbour area after the birthday lunch, we saw some LEGO minifigures and whale sculptures on display.

The LEGO minifigures are life size versions of popular LEGO characters, installed as part of World Play Day. It was hard
to get photos with the minifigures because there are so many
kids playing with them.

Whale Tales are a set of 30 whale tale sculptures along Sydneyâ€™s Western Harbour waterfront.
