In the morning, we visited Floriade. This is the first year since the COVID-190 pandemic
that the festival is back at the Commonwealth Park. Although the flower display is smaller than pre-COVID years, it was still very enjoyable. The highlight was meeting a group of Vietnamese ladies all dressed identically in yellow kaftans. They took me in as a long lost sister and we took a number of group photos together.
