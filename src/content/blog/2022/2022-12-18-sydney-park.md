Sydney Park is made of 40 hectares of lush grass, landscaped gardens, rolling hills, meandering pathways and picturesque wetlands. Creeks flow throughout the park and attract all different types of birds. There are plenty of spacious viewing decks that are perfectly placed to make sure you can take it all in as long as you like. Sydney Park is popular for weekend picnics and itâ€™s very dog friendly.
