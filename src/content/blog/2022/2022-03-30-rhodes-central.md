Visited Hong Kong Street Food at Rhodes_Central. They have cleverly designed the decor so it looks like you are on an MTR train, then stepped out at Mong Kok station, then walking around the street with well known Hong Kong store signs above you and then somehow magically entered this street cafe. I had the fried rice with fried dace and olives and it was pretty tasty, and it comes with a cup of milk tea. The lemon iced tea with the ice teddy bear is too cute for words! Will definitely come back again, even though it is on the expensive side.
