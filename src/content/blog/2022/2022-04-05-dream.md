Today's dream was a long one featuring me setting up and then attending a party with uni classmates. I was involved in setting up the sound system and we also installed some cameras doing time lapses. One room had a massive LEGO installation which reminded me of a scene from Star Wars. It had laser cannons which I thought were fake but they turned out to actually fire laser beams. One of them hit my leg and I felt a slight burning sensation. There was a massive food buffet as well - I think I gorged a bit before the party started.
