Paramount+ Illuminates Sydney Harbour With The Southern Hemisphere’s Largest Ever Drone Light Show At Vivid Sydney.

With a cacophony of 600 drones, history was made last night over Sydney’s magnificent Harbour.

With the help of SKYMAGIC, Paramount+ transformed the wintery evening sky into a sprawling canvas, as a fleet of 600 perfectly choreographed LED-equipped drones shape shifted and synchronised into enormous 3D images and sequences, illustrating some of the premier streaming service’s most iconic stars and scenes.

Illuminating the Sydney skyline, the drones painted quintessential scenes and objects including a Mission Impossible countdown clock, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds’ U.S.S Enterprise, SpongeBob SquarePants himself, HALO’s Master Chief and Cortana’s voiceover, PAW Patrol’s Chase, Top Gun’s fighter jet, South Park’s orange-clad Kenny, and the brand-new logo for the highly anticipated, crime-fighting local production, NCIS: Sydney.
