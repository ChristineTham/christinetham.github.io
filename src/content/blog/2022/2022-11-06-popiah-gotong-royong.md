It's gotong royong time again - making popiah at Sharon Wong and Auntie Kim's house. So many people all keen to make and eat popiah - no wonder, it is my favourite Malaysian snack. I didn't realise how many ingredients are in it and how much effort it takes to make. Unfortunately I am terrible at wrapping popiah so I ended up making sang choi bau with popiah skin and filling! I was so full I had 4 big servings! Also featuring Cheng's delicious Japanese cheesecake, Aileen's konnyaku fruit jelly, Karen's lemon meringue, and Jennifer's huge fruit platter. Many thanks to Sharon and Auntie for hosting and preparing, and everyone else for contributing.
