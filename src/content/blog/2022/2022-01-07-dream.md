Weird dream: I am working at a theme park. One of the attractions was guests being able to interact with celebrities, ie. go on rides with them. I was assigned to accompany and support Ewan McGregor. There weren't a lot of visitors, and I was amused some of them didn't recognise Ewan, or believe it was really him, so I got to chat with him a bit. I asked him where his favourite places in the world are, and he mentioned a few obscure places I have never been too, typically islands. He can be surprisingly moody. Anyway, I was surprised his fingernails were beautifully manicured and painted a delicate shade of pink. His hands were so small and soft, like a little girl.
