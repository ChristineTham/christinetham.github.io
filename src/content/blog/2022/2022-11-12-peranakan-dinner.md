Peranakan Association Australia NSW Annual Dinner at Castle Terrace Chinese Cuisine - so good to see new and established friends and so many ladies wearing beautiful kebaya. The food was really good and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Unfortunately I had to leave early so missed out on dessert and dancing.
