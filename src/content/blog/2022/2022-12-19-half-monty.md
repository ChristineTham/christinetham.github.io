Did the Wahoo SYSTM Half Monty fitness test this morning. Looks like my FTP have finally improved to 181 watts. I've given up on trying to reach 200 - at my age I'll take whatever results I get. My Threshold Heart Rate has also reduced to 162 - this sounds about right - it's actually my theoretical maximum.
