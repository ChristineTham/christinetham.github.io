Interesting exhibition at the Art Gallery on the topic of the Way We Eat (as you know, a favourite subject of mine). I love the nyonya container, as well as the artificial but life looking strawberries.

I have nearly forgotten how good the Leica M10 is at capturing images. Teaching Lyn Cheah how to focus using the rangefinder. Her efforts are good! PS - I've always thought Autumn (sculpture) has nice legs.

Another "animal kavorka" photo. I took this picture of an ibis using a Leica M10 and 50mm lens, so you can appreciate to get this perspective I would have been standing right next to it. It wasn't bothered by me at all, and made no attempt to fly away.

Artisans in the Gardens at the Lion Gate Lodge, Botanical Gardens. We haven't visited this event since pre COVID, so it's good to see they are back again.
