We booked a night at Hunter Valley to use up our Stay NSW vouchers which were expiring soon.

We drove up to Hunter Valley on 5 October, and it pretty much rained the whole day. We tried to take photos of the murals at Kurri Kurri, but gave up because the rain became heavier. So we had an early lunch and checked into Grapevines Accommodation - a boutique accommodation provider. We had a pleasant afternoon - it's quaint and cosy and right in the heart of Pokolbin next to all the attractions. At night we could hear the soft sound of rain falling which helped us sleep.

The next day we had breakfast at Enzo's cafe - super delicious and literally across the road from where we stayed. Afterwards, we wandered around Pepper's Creek estate.
