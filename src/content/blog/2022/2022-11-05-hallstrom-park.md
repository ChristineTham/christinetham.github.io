## Hallstrom Park

Named after Sir Edward Hallstrom (1886-1970), resident of Northbridge and owner of the Silent Knight Refrigerator Factory in Willoughby. In 1946 he contributed 3,000 pounds for the improvement of this land for recreation and sporting use.

The playground design is based on the layout of Taronga Park Zoo, where he was Trust Chairman for 10 years. The large adventure playground was built in 1998, and upgraded in 2016. Artistic features of the playground include sandstone animals carved by Chris Bennett, sense activated sound elements, an interactive “musicosaurus” by Jerome Lynons and forged metal fence and grate detail by Libby Tulip and Phil Spark. A stone crocodile lies in the drainage channel, camouflaged by rocks lining the channel. A continuous accessible path (flat to gently undulating) links the playground elements, including a mound slide (no steps), sandpit and water pump. The playground also contains a wide embankment slide, carousel, turtle dome climber, children's bike track and swings including a basket swing.

## Incinerator Art Space

The Incinerator is an iconic and heritage-listed building, designed by Walter Burley Griffin. It retains its strong Modernist style of architecture. The interior has been sensitively renovated to create a professional gallery space that lends itself to exhibit a broad range of contemporary art in a distinct environment. Incinerator Art Space strives to offer the community a hub for showcasing exceptional, innovative and timely visual art exhibitions
