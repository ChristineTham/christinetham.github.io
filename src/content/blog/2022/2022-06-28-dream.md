I stole a car! (in my dream). It's a gigantic but stylish electric pickup truck. It has a keyless lock and ignition, but I managed to hack the app and unlocked the car. It's right hand drive though, so it was weird driving it. The instrumentation panel was really complicated. I parked it near a shopping centre. It started raining heavily and I was rushing to get into the centre and had to climb a flight of stairs. A woman in front of me was carrying a bicycle up the stairs, I remember the back wheel was spinning in front of me.
