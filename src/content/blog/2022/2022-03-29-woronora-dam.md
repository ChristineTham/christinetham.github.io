Last in the series on spilling dams. We reached Woronora Dam just as the weather was clearing. Unfortunately, the dam was closed, but we were able to capture shots of the spillway, which is magnificent. It's a serpentine design followed by a step cascade into a narrow gorge cut from the hill. It almost looks like something out of a science fiction movie.
