These are delicious melt in your mouth biscuits that you just cannot stop eating. I didn't take any photos (except of the results) so most of these photos are from Sharon Wong who also gave us the recipe for the dough mix (I like the ones made with sago flour).

Lunch at Cat Town as part of our next "gotong royong" project. Cat is trying some new recipes, including a delicious Larb Woon Seng (pork and glass noodles), Hor Mok (similar to otak otak) and Miang Kham. I have never had the latter before and it's a revelation - taste bomb. There is a video of me assembling one and tasting it which I am not posting because ... ahem ... the conversation isn't entirely "safe for work"
