After visiting Bundanoon, we stopped by at Guildford for an early dinner. Due to the heavy lunch we had earlier in the day, we shared a plate of 6 lamb and chicken satays, and also had some roti canai and pasembor.

The satay was the best I've had in recent times. Reminds me of Mamak in their early days. We also had roti canai and pasembor but forgot to take photos, and we bought nasi lemak and biryani.
