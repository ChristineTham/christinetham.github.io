Today's dream is a musical one: my brother and I are trying to deconstruct an arpeggiated synth sequence. Fortunately, I realised I have had this dream before, so I was able to shortcut to the answer, which is a set of descending staccato notes but with some high pass filter manipulations. I then realised I have a separate memory compartment for dreams, which is only accessible when I am in a dream like state. Whilst I was still half awake, I was able to remember many previous dreams, including some set in our previous home - an apartment in Annandale, and some set in an imaginary valley.
