A lovely Xmas celebration hosted by Cat Bowrey and featuring her delicious Thai cooking. We had a selection of entrees, including larb duck, pumpkin salad, pork balls, savoury crackers, and tofu. The main is the classic Thai dish of leg of pork with preserved vegetables, kai lan, egg and intestines. It was also a celebration of our friendship, and we had a delightful afternoon of singing Xmas carols and Who Am I trivia game. We also exchanged presents. It was originally supposed to be a Pirate Santa event but we agreed to cancel because we got too attached to the presents we unwrapped. Thank you Cat for cooking and organising, and everyone else for being such a good friend this year. Dessert featured Aileen's sponge cake, Jennifer's fruit platter, pineapple tarts and fruitcake that Karen bought from Mahes, and some gingerbread biscuits that I bought from Aldi.

This is what happens when you buy a $30 Selfie Ring Light Kit from Aldi and you have friends ...
