My Columbia Ravenous Omni Tech trail shoes started disintegrating, with the sole
coming off the shoes. I took it to a cobbler, but he said it can't be repaired,
and said throw it away.

I used shoe glue and sticky tape to hold it together until the glue dried, and
surprisingly it worked. Hopefully I'll get a few more months of use from it.
