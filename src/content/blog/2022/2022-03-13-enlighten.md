The Enlighten Festival will once again shine a spotlight on the nation’s capital over 17 days of culture and creativity.

Witness thought-provoking large-scale projections on some of the capital’s most loved and iconic buildings. The projections will be presented on Australian Parliament House, the National Library of Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, Questacon, the National Portrait Gallery and the Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House. Feast on tasty treats from local food and beverage vendors, enjoy live music and snap a selfie with the creatively crafted art installations.

This year I forgot to take my tripod with me which turned out to be a blessing as it allowed us to be more mobile and take more creative shots.
