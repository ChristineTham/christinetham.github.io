Fried rice with pork luncheon meat and olive greens: I have been threatening to cook this dish for a while now, to the point my friends are starting to ask when will I cook it. Today's the day! The secret is to make sure the pork luncheon meat is well rendered (nobody likes soft lardy pieces), and the rice is well separated. Don't overtoss or the rice will start breaking.

The pork luncheon meat
is marinated with egg batter and wok fried until crispy, and then veges
(carrots and beans) and aromats (garlic and shallots) are added, before
finishing with rice and egg.
