This internationally acclaimed project brings to life the iconic, maximalist campaigns by virtuosic Gucci Creative Director Alessandro Michele.

Gucci Garden Archetypes first opened in Florence in 2021 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Gucci’s founding. The exhibition’s cinematic installations have captivated audiences across Shanghai, Taipei, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul and it is now coming to Australia, exclusively at the Powerhouse.

Gucci Garden Archetypes captures the spirit of each iconic collection, while reflecting the philosophy of Michele and his collaborations across music, art, travel and contemporary culture which resonate throughout Gucci’s campaigns. Design studio Archivio Personale has transformed Michele’s vision into immersive spaces.
