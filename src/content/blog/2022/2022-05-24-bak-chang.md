It has been a while since we had a gotong royong session due to various reasons, but we decided to make chang.

Also known as zongzi, this is seasoned glutinous rice plus a number of ingredients (pork belly, salted egg yolk, peanut, mushroom, lap cheong) wrapped in bamboo leaves, and then boiled or steamed.

Although available all year round, chang is normally eaten on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month marks the Duanwu Festival (also known as the Dragon Boat Festival).

One thing for sure, my chang wrapping skills are terrible and didn't improve over time, but everyone had a good time. Special thanks to Cat Bowrey for organising and hosting, Sharon Wong and her mum for guiding and giving instructions, Karen Lim for helping me wrap some of my chang, and everyone else for their food and company.
