It's been a while since we had our last gotong royong. Today we are focused on making that classic Petaling St street food: KL Hokkien mee.

It's a deceptively simple recipe, but we all discovered the perfect dish (which depends on individual taste) requires a fine sense of balance and timing, not to mention lashings of pork lard and ... ahem ... "croutons" (chee yau char).

Many thanks to Cat Bowrey for providing most of the ingredients and preparing the pork lard and golden nuggets. Thanks to Jennifer Hicks and Sharon Whitney for the desserts, and Sharon Wong for whipping up the chilli paste in the Thermomix.

Special awards to Karen Lim for being "Princess of the Day," Sharon Whitney for being the "mysterious contestant," and Jennifer Hicks for being the token Disney.
