Musical dream: I was in school, and the teacher was asking everyone to either sing or play something, and I was shitting kittens wondering what to play and whether I remember anything well enough. I ended up playing this (original composition).

After waking up, I figured out the melody and tried to harmonise it with a simple 4/4 beat. I used a hackneyed descending interval progression of I-VIm-IV-I-V-IV, but it doesn't sound quite right, so will appreciate if anyone can suggest anything better.

My problem is my simple brain is not comfortable with jazz sevenths, even though the melody seems to suggest them.
