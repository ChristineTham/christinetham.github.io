Wow, what a dream: I had the ability of telekinesis - I can make objects move through mind power, just like Luke Skywalker and the lightsaber. In my dream, I had things dangling from the ceiling on elastic strings, and I am able to move them towards or away from me. Then I dreamt I "woke up" (in reality moving from level 2 dream to level 1) and STILL had the ability. So I was excitedly moving objects across the floor, ranging from pieces of paper to shoes and even laptops. It is such a crushing disappointment to discover I don't have this skill in real life after finally waking up. Even now, I am reflexively flexing my hand at objects and expecting them to fly towards me - the feeling I have this ability is still so strong.
