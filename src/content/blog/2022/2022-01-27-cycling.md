This is weird: Straight after I parked my car today, and before I could even take out my bicycle, a man sidled up to me and asked me if I was interested in going riding with him. I said I was riding with some friends, but he was more than welcome to join us. He declined. Quite a few times I've even been asked to go out on a date by random strangers whilst cycling. I would have thought helmet hair and sweat wasn't very sexy or appealing but who knows.
