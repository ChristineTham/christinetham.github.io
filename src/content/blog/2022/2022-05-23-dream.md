Today's dream: I am staying at a resort when I noticed someone using a next generation phone.

It has a screen on both sides, and by default is transparent, i.e. behaves like a glass. The screen on each side shows what's behind, so you are effectively looking "through" the phone.

The phone works using augmented reality, it layers virtual objects and annotations over what it displays. So when you hover the device over your hand, for example, it tells you your body statistics like heartrate, blood sugar, oxygen levels etc. When you point at an object it describes the object. It can translate foreign language, etc if you point it towards a piece of paper or sign. If you hold it between yourself and another person, it can act as a simultaneous translator and interpreter.

I thought it was an interesting device. In the dream, I was still using my iPhone X, so I feel positively ancient.
