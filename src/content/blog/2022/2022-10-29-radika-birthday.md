Celebrating Radika Lee's birthday with a picnic at Bicentennial Park. Lots of food, starting with tuna and sardine sandwiches (great if you wedge in a potato crisp for extra crunchiness), cheese platter, mixed nuts, chicken wings, sushi, curry puffs, yakitori sticks and finishing off with birthday cake and tea. Special thanks to Cat Bowrey for organising, Aileen Lim for the birthday cake, and CinDy Yeoh RaNa for bringing little koala and hubby along.
