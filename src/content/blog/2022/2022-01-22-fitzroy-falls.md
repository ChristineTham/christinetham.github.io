Running from Fitzroy Falls Visitor Centre to Warrawong lookout in the northern section of the park, this self-guided wildflower walk is a nature-loverâ€™s dream.

The first 1.25 kilometre, known as Wildflower walk, is an easy stroll showcasing the beautiful scenery of Morton National Park.

We then extended the walk by following East Rim walk. There are several more lookouts over the valley that make this walk a photographers dream in the right light. Due to recent rains, the track was quite muddy, but the falls were gorgeous. We met another walker who kindly took photos of us.
