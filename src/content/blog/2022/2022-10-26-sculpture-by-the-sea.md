Sculpture by the Sea returned to the Bondi to Tamarama Beach coastal walk as the worldâ€™s largest free to the public sculpture exhibition in 2022. The spectacular coastal walk was again transformed into a 2km long sculpture park over three weeks featuring more than 100 sculptures by artists from Australia and across the world.
