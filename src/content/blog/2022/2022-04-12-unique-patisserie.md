There is no #EasterGirlsRoadTrip without a stop at Katoomba for our favourite Malaysian restaurant in the Blue Mountains: Unique Patisserie. It's good to be in a big group so we can try more dishes. The bak kut teh was amazing but it is a meal and half! The nasi goreng Penang was really good and spicy!
