NCR Legends Xmas lunch at the Rag and Famish - I worked here in the early 90s and I haven't seen some of these people for over 30 years! So enjoyable meeting mostly familiar but some new faces and catching up with what people have been doing. When I worked here, it was early in my career and I thought most workplaces were like this. I now realise it was a pretty special and magical place to work in and I had some of the best moments of my working life here.
