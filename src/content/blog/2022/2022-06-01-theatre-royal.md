After that, we watched "An American in Paris" at the newly renovated Theatre Royal Sydney. The musical is based on the Gene Kelly film which in turn was inspired by a tone poem by George Gershwin. I found it a bit weird and confusing, but then I don't like musicals. The ballet bit in the middle was interesting.
