Dinner at Chinta Ria Buddha Love with CinDy Yeoh RaNa and Lyn Cheah. It's a fusion restaurant rather than pure Malaysian. The lobak is called "sassy roll" and made with chicken, the sam dan wong is called "sam ting wong" and is steamed egg with crab meat, and the sensual prawns is king prawns on crispy vermicelli with garlic sauce. We didn't book, but the mâitre d' (Peter) allocated us a table because of a no show.
