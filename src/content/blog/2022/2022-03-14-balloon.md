Marvel at hot air balloons floating across the city during the Canberra Balloon Spectacular. Held over nine days, the Canberra skyline turns into a sea of colour and movement. The balloons launch each morning, weather permitting, from 12 -20 March at Patrick White Lawns. For those who have braved the dawn start thereâ€™s a hot breakfast to enjoy as the balloons lift off and drift across the dawn sky.

Mt Ainslie lookout - great views of Canberra - Parliament House, War Memorial, CBD, Lake Burley Griffin.

Canberra pre-dawn from Mt Ainslie, and watching the balloons take off. No tripod!

Canberra Balloon Festival - we chased the balloons around the city. Managed to find parking spot on Acton Park itself which was a miracle - cars were circling around like vultures. Also went to Black Mountain where we saw the sloth hanging above plus some balloons landing in Tuggeranong, then went to the Arboretum but sadly no balloons landed there.
