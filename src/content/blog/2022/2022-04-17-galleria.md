"Trip to Italy" with Margaret Stow and Lyn Cheah. It really felt like we were wandering around in a small town in Italy, but in reality we were at Galleria Ettalong Beach. Would love to watch Cinema Paradiso at Cinema Paradiso. We sneaked into the motel rooms upstairs, and even discovered an Roman style swimming pool. I was in such a tourist mode I ended up buying a pair of pants and shoes.
