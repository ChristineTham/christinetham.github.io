Replicating another of my mum's dishes - pork luncheon meat fritters. Sliced thinly, lightly coated with egg and cornflour batter. The secret is to cook them until they are almost crispy but not quite, so the outside is slightly crunchy but the inside is soft and moist.

I am not ashamed to admit it, my favourite food when I was a child is
pork luncheon meat (from a can branded "Ma Ling"). My mum used to pan fry them
until slightly crispy with a batter of cornflour, egg and soy sauce. This is
my attempt at replicating the dish.
