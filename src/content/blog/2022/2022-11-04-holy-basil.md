Lunch at the new Holy Basil at Darling Square with Lyn Cheah and CinDy Yeoh RaNa. Wow, the decor here is fabulous! The food and service are excellent too! We had a fabulous time and little koala Ryoko Ryeea was a bundle of joy - very well behaved today and lots of smiles and gurgles.

Fantastic Thai desserts at Mango CoCo Thai Dessert Cafe Sydney. The DIY Volcano is super theatrical, and the mango sago really nice. Can definitely have dessert as a meal here. With Lyn Cheah and CinDy Yeoh RaNa.
