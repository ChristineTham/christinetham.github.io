We started our walk at Lighthouse beach, after catching a bus. Our guardian angel was active - we thought we had missed the bus, and may have to wait an hour. Lyn said let's just wait for a few minutes, and the bus turned up. This turned out to be a very long beach but has interesting rock formations. Found an interesting translucent stone that reminded me of the Volucite crystal from Laputa.

After that, we visited Tacking Point Lighthouse - a picture postcard perfect lighthouse framed by Little Bay.

From the lighthouse, we walked to Town Green Port Macquarie. This is normally a 9km walk but because we started from Lighthouse beach, it ended up being a 13km walk mostly on beach but also on track.
