Taking a trip down memory lane with lunch at Malay Chinese Laksa. I have visited this establishment since the 1980s, and the owners still recognise me from back then. It's amazing that they have witnessed my entire working career from when I was a fresh faced young graduate to my retirement, and they are STILL working there!
