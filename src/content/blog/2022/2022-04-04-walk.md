A blatantly self promoting and boasting post: Finally managed to fit into a size 10 (M) skirt. Okay, it's tight, and I can't actually sit down comfortably or breathe properly, but at least I can wear it.

Decided to wear this outfit to walk from Roseville to Artarmon to collect my
car from servicing. It's a lovely day.

Ever since Armidale, when a young joey and its mother came close to us to stare at us, I think I may have developed animal kavorka. Wild animals don't seem to be afraid of me, and don't mind me getting quite close to them. I am not saying I am Snow White, but a mynah bird flew to a tree next to me and started chirping at me. This is a bush turkey that saw me and literally jumped onto the fence and started strutting its stuff and showing off.
