Wow what a day! We went on a Malaysian/Singaporean food crawl at Burwood. First stop was Tàstý Øf Pênáng where we sampled almost every major dish on their menu: assam laksa, har mee, CKT, wat tan hor, hokkien char, chee cheong fun. After that we had desserts at Rickshaw Cafe, and finally ended up at Burwood Chinatown where we had goreng pisang from Malaysia's Ah Moi. It was non stop eating and fantastic day hanging out the new and established friends.
