Well, believe it or not, but the soreness of my legs was a lot less today, so I decided to cycle Cape Fermentor in Spain (virtually on Wahoo RGT) from cape to beach. Took me just over an hour, and my legs actually felt good. Of course, it was mostly downhill apart from two short and sharp climbs and a long 4km climb.
