## Lunch at Mittagong RSL Club.

Great food, will definitely come back here again. Karen Lim and I were like little kids fighting for our position in the queue, the lady behind was laughing. Guess which dish was mine. Also guess who had 2 surplus chicken wings and didn't share with anyone.

## Highdown

A plant collectors delight surrounds this 1880's house, recently revitalised and planted with interesting collections of perennials and bulbs under the mature trees. This is my personal favourite garden, mainly because we were allowed to go into the house and I was able to chat to the owner, a delightful and eclectic woman whose husband was an artist.

## Dinner at Bundanoon Hotel.

The bartender was smitten by one of us, and lavishing her with attention and care. We were clearly the loudest table in the the dining room, and at one stage everyone was looking at us when we roared with laughter. The steaks were great, and I was so full I couldn't even finish my beer.
