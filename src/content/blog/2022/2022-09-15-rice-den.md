Great lunch at the Rice Den organised by Eemie Ong. It was a good opportunity to celebrate the birthdays of Adeline Lamond, Lynn Lee and Wendy Moon. I had never tried the food here, and
it was delicious. I particularly liked the prawn toast, the steamed
scallops, and the two fried rice dishes we had. We also sampled some emping, butter cookies and pineapple tarts bought from Singapore. Sorry I did not capture the sago pudding and a few other photos - my camera actually ran out of battery!
