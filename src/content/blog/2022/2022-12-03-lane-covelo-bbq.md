Lane Covelo post ride Xmas BBQ. I expended almost all my energy getting to Church Point, and by the time we were in Terrey Hills my body was already giving signals that it was low on energy reserves. Sure enough, I started to bonk on Pacific Highway, but the bunch nursed me back. I practically coasted the last few hundred metres because my legs were on the verge of cramping. Paul said he liked my new tattoo, and I said "What tattoo?" and he pointed to my legs and I went "Oh!"
