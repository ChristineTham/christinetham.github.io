Noël Sydney is a magical, free Christmas festival. This Christmas storybook experience is set in Macquarie Street and the Royal Botanic Garden Sydney and has two magical chapters, full of nostalgia with a modern twist.

Follow the Noël Light Trail on Macquarie Street, leading through the majestic Christmas colonnade to the Conservatorium Gates and enter the Digital Christmas Forest where you will feel the magic of Christmas come alive right in the heart of Sydney.

We visited with Lyn's family. It was a good excuse to get into the Xmas spirit early!
