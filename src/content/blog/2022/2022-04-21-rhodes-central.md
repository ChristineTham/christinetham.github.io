Celebrating our anniversary by dressing up in Rilakkuma and Hello Kitty outfits and dining at Hong Kong Street Food 好上好冰室. I had a nostalgic dish - cart noodles with pork luncheon meat, beef brisket and sausages in true HK style. Lyn Cheah had the beef hor fun which is really good. After that we took a few kawaii photos around Rhodes_Central.
