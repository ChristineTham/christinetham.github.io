Chinese New Year lunch. I had to go all the way to Castle Mall (Supreme BBQ) to buy the BBQ meats - I originally wanted to go to BBQ One in Eastwood but the queue stretched around the block almost to the carpark and doubled in size as I was debating whether to join the queue. Loh hon chai by Lyn Cheah, yee sang and noodles by Ping Cheah, fish by Soong Cheah, peking duck pancakes by James Kerridge.
