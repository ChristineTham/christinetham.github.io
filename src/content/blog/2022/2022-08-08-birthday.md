Amazing joint birthday celebration with Lyn Cheah at The Eight Modern Chinese Restaurant with a Hello Kitty/pink theme. Thank you to Sharon Whitney for organising, Aileen Lim for the cake, Cat Bowrey for the special gifts, and everyone else for contributing to the event and more importantly to the fun and the joy! The food was sumptuous and the company divine!
