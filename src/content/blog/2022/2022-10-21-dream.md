Today's dream: I am on a business trip, and my hands are full juggling a (pink) suitcase, umbrella, drink bottle and handbag. We are coming down on an elevator, and decided to stop at Level 45 to change over to the express elevator. When it arrived, it was quite small so we all had to squeeze in. I used my suitcase to block the doors until it started beeping on me.

Surprisingly, when the elevator reached ground level, it was able to travel sideways, out of the building, across the courtyard, into the next building. I was really impressed.

Later on, I had to comfort a crying project manager. I think her colleagues have been saying bad things about her. I reassured her that she was a good project manager, one of the best I've worked with. At the end, she said "I hope you are not going to charge me for this meeting." I replied "No, not for the first hour anyway" and grinned.
