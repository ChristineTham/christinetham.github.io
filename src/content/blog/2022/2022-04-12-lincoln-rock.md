We stopped by at Lincoln's Rock. They closed the road for helicopter training, but graciously allowed us to walk to the rock. The mist obscured the view of the valley below, but made the place looks eerie and mysterious, almost as if we were at the edge of the world. Fifi Harris Kitchen showed us where she normally poses for that Instagram worthy shot of her hanging off the cliff, but none of us were brave enough to try it. After all of Fifi's scary stories of snakes, we actually saw a (dead) snake on the road!
