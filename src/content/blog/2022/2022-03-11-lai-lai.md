Went to Eastwood to try the Singapore and Malaysian place at Eastwood Foodie Street, supposedly famous for their Hainanese Chicken Rice (or hainan chi fan). We were not disappointed - the rice was aromatic without being too oily, and the chicken (served slightly cold and gelatinous) was deliciously succulent and flavoursome. I think the chili sauce can be improved but overall this is way above average. Extremely cheap meal, we ordered the half chicken and large rice which is enough to serve at least 2 people and under $9 per person.
