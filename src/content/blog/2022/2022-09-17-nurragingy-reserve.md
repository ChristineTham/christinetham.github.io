I need more practice wearing a kimono, so decided to visit
the Chang Lai Yuan Garden at Nurragingy Reserve. It was a good
opportunity to pose with the flower blossoms. Luckily there
weren't too many people around, even though it was a Saturday
afternoon. I think it's because the skies are cloudy and there
was intermittent rain.
