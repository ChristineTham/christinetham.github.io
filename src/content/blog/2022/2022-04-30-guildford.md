Selamat Hari Raya aidilfitri! These are some photos of us at Guildford on Sat, visiting the food stalls. Love the atmosphere! Everyone around us were speaking Malay, ordering food in Malay, I really felt like I was in Malaysia!. The food was also yummy and authentic, every dish was a winner as far as I am concerned.
