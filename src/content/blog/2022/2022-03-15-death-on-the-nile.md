We watched Death on the Nile at Event Cinemas. The film was surprisingly better than I expected, given I was a bit disappointed by Kenneth Branagh's version of Murder on the Orient Express. Kenneth's sense of flamboyance suits this over the top Agatha Christie whodunnit very well. Not sure about the prologue proving the back story to Poirot's moustache. We were surprised to see a playground in front of the screen. We decided to play on it after the movie - apparently they show matinees for children where the kids can play in front watched by parents on recliners. Next time, we will have to try sitting in a recliner - you can't book them, but we were told by the attendant you can grab them if you arrive early enough.
