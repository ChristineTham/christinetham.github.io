After a few months of indoor cycling, I have finally completed every single Sufferfest workout on Wahoo SYSTM. I did skip the no video ones and some of the longer ones, but basically did everything else.

I never want to hear the phrases Sufferlandria, donuts, laser goats and Gunther von Agony ever again in my life.
