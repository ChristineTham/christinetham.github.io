My dream last night: I am trying to return home after attending a conference, but cannot find an available flight. However, I had access to the airline rostering system, so I scheduled myself as a flight attendant on a flight, donned the uniform, and boarded the plane. The last thing I remembered was trying to familiarise myself with the pre-takeoff procedures.
