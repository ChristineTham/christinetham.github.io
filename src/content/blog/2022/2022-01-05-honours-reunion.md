## Recreating an outfit ... 35 years later.

The first photo is that of me taken in 1987, when I was at uni. I am wearing my favourite tank top, bought at a Spandau Ballet concert in 1985, plus cream pants, pink shoes and a pink belt, I also have a light jacket casually wrapped around my neck, plus sunglasses.

Believe it or not, I still own that tank top, and it still fits. So, I attempted to recreate the look for our Honours Year class reunion 35 years later.

The new photos were taken at Sydney University on my camera by Stuart Pook.

## 35th Honours Year reunion

My favourite year of my undergraduate studies at Sydney University was my Honours year - the class size was small and we got along well with each other. Despite our diverse backgrounds, we blended and emulsified with each other like ingredients of a salad.

We spent a lot of time with each other in the common room - some of us practically lived there, and we absorbed each other's tastes in music, TV and movies, and sometimes mannerisms and outlook in life. A few of us even fell in love with each other.

Even now, despite the fact I haven't seen some since graduation, I was amazed at how comfortable we were with each other, carrying conversations seemingly as if we last met the day before. One of us flew in from the US, and other from France. Three of us have retired, and unfortunately one of us has passed away.

Special thanks to Hugh McGuinness for connecting everyone, organising and making this all possible.

## Dinner

To maintain my reputation for posting food photos, here are photos of what we had for dinner at Otto Noorba Glebe for our Honours year reunion. Group photo includes Jarryl Wirth but excludes Luke.
