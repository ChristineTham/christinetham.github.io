My dream today: I am trying out a self driving car. It's cute - in self driving mode the dashboard turns pink. We went along Military Rd (Sydney's busiest road). The traffic was heavy at first, but suddenly the road cleared out and became empty. The car likes driving at the speed limit whenever it can, which I thought was too fast for Military Rd because of the narrow lanes and parked cars. It even tried to climb the steep hills of Mosman at the speed limit. At one stage it was quite scary because there were a lot of pedestrians crossing the road but fortunately the car avoided them, but I didn't like the way it criss-crossed the lane to do so.
