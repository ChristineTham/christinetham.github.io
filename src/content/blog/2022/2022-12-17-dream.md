Today's dream: I am living in the future. Shopping has changed, shops are basically display showrooms only. You can play with the merchandise and try it on, but there is no stock. When you buy an item, it just gets shipped to your house, and often arrive before you get home. Some "shops" are just window displays and a QR code. As a result, no one carries shopping bags.

Instead of elevators, you just jump into a helical chute and glide to your destination.

After shopping, my brother picked me up in his car. I was surprised, because it was a different car from when we left home with my mum. It is much smaller. He said he went back home to change to a smaller car because we didn't need the big car. I said I think I left my handbag in the other car and he said he's pretty sure he transferred everything to the new car. I searched around but couldn't find my handbag. I used "Find My" on the phone and it did say the handbag was in the car.
