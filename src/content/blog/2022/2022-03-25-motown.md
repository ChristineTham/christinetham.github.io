"Dancing In The Shadows Of Motown" (DITSOM) has been taking metropolitan and country audiences by storm since forming in 2017. This dynamic "all-singing all-dancing" band has performed sold out shows at many major venues.

We attended a Dancing in the Shadows of Motown concert on a Sydney Harbour cruise.

We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I am normally a wallflower, but somehow transformed myself into a dancing butterfly the music was so good. On the plus side, we met Pauline who joined us for concert. Thank you Cat Bowrey for organising! Sydney Harbour is so beautiful in the sunset and at night.

What an amazing rendition of Ain't No Mountain High Enough by Dancing in the Shadows of Motown on a Sydney Harbour Cruise. Such a wonderful performance, absolutely enjoyed ourselves and it was a great vibe and everyone was super friendly.
