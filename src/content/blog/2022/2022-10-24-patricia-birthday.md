Celebrating Patricia Yong's birthday at Chefs Gallery Regent Place. Lots of delicious dishes here - my favourite is the tofu and the fried rice with three kinds of eggs. The beef tataki was interesting. Afterwards we all had some birthday cake made by Lynn Lee at the nearby Pavilion. It was good meeting Shannon and Mahes for the first time!
