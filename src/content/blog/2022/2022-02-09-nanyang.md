Experiencing the amazing Lunar New Year Celebration menu at Nanyang Tea Club organised by Aileen Lim. Great friends celebrating a great menu. I didn't quite meet the "Oriental" dress code but scraped through with my red bra which you can see in some photos. We all look so cute wearing the crab bibs! The photo of the singapore noodles are courtesy of Sharon Whitney as I was so greedy I forgot to take a shot.
