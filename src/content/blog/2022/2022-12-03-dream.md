My dream today: we have all become subjects under the rule of an Emperor of the Known Universe. He is a bit of an uber-Trump - completely narcissistic and vain.

Of course he lives in a palace full of concubines. He doesn't actually have any time to service us all, he'll just drop in unannounced late in the night, mostly drunk, and all he wants is a bit of a hug and cuddle before crashing out on the bed.

I've been asked to compile and organise his Book of Rules. They are currently written on pieces of paper - he just gets whoever is nearby to write them down whenever he gets an Idea. I am trying to sort and categorise them, but really its hopeless they are all arbitrary and moment in time specific, like Elon's tweets.

One day I stole one of his cars and crashed through the palace gates. I think he was more amused than angry.
