We had a great assam laksa making session at Rita Enar's house - it all started when we were at Unique Patisserie eating their assam laksa and Rita said I should try hers one day, and I said I would love to. So, we all got together and decided to make assam laksa at her place.

I learnt some important techniques that day - mainly how to julienne cucumber, slice buah kantang and how to cut up a pineapple. I am so glad Margaret Stow and Emily Lee arrived just in time to debone the fish, otherwise I would have to do it. Joey Dallesandro came in with his fish cakes (seriously, the sauce was awesome). Soon everyone else arrived and the eating got seriously started.

What can I say, it was truly the best assam laksa I have had in my life. Rita being Rita, she couldn't help but feed us with a variety of other food including her famous curry puffs, RFC (Rita Fried Chicken), BBQ chicken wings and even roast pork. Emily Lee brought some fruit salt seasoning from Singapore which we had with pineapple and jambu. We finished off having goreng pisang (fried banana) for dessert.

All in all a 15/10 day and I was so full I had nothing for dinner.
