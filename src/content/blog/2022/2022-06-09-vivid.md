## For Sydney with Love

Ken Done and Sydney. A love story spanning 80 years. He is the city’s great chronicler, and she has been his most enduring muse. In this creative relationship, he has explored every facet of the city’s soul and continually reveals something new.
A master of colour, Ken captures the joy of Sydney like no other artist and this vibrant animation projected onto Customs House shows how his beloved city informs all his work. It is a story of optimism, colour, and sheer delight.
Celebrate the city, its icons and natural environment – on the foreshore and the harbour, under the sea, in the sky – as seen through the artist’s imagination.
“The joy of colour and the great pleasure of living in Sydney. A constant source of inspiration to a lifetime of work.” – Ken Done
