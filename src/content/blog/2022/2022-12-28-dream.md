My dream this morning - I am travelling in a Time Machine across the Book of Days. I set the dial towards my birthday, and I found inscribed in the sand amidst flashes of light:

“Memories of distant purple orchid haze.”

The Music of the Universe was transitioning from VI minor to V. I remembered thinking: “Well, that’s a non traditional root resolution, but at at least it’s in a major key.”
