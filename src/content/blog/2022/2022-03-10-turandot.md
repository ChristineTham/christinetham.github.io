Pre-opera dinner at Mordeo Bistro & Bar with Aileen Lim and Margaret Stow - the food was delicious - we were so full we were afraid we would fall asleep at the opera so we promised to nudge each other if one of us started nodding off.

Opera night - watching Turandot with Aileen Lim and Margaret Stow. Really amazing performance, there are elements Margaret and I both remember from previous productions but the costumes and sets are all new and really impressive. We had a lot of "helpers" more than willing to take photos of us including a super friendly security guard who even asked us if we wanted extra photos.
