Winter rainy day is perfect for trying out hot pot at Spice World Hot Pot Australia. This place is pretty funky. They serve the hot pot ingredients on robots, and you can order the soup base with a melting Hello Kitty. This is my first experience eating hot pot, and it was a delightful one.

The restaurant also features robots that deliver the food to the table.
