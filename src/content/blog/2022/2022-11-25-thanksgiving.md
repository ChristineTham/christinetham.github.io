Celebrating Thanksgiving with dinner at the Harvest Buffet at the Star. This year, I have many things to be thankful for, including health, happiness, finances and spirituality, but a special highlight is the friendship of these ladies who I met around this time last year. The friendship and bond that can form between women is truly remarkable and long may the sisterhood continue. I have learnt so much from these women and hopefully there will be much more joy, laughter and food in the future. We managed to get an "uncle" to take some photos of us at the Gin and Tea, and he turned out to be Malaysian born as well!
