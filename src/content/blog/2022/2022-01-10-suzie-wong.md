Just finished watching "The World of Suzie Wong." For some reason, I was given the impression as a child that the film is rather salacious and not suitable viewing for young impressionable minds.

Watching it now, it seems rather tame, but I loved the scenes depicting Hong Kong in 1960. Ladder St looks so different these days compared to back then. I couldn't help noticing quite a few scenes from Blade Runner have parallels with this film, and I wonder whether Ridley Scott consciously or subconsciously tried to emulate the look of this film.

I also wonder how much of James Clavell's Noble House is inspired by this film.
