Movie day: eating lunch at Khao Pla and watching Everything Everywhere All At Once at Event Cinemas.

I must say, I kinda enjoyed the film and it's good to see a mostly Asian cast (and very surprised to see Short Round from Indiana Jones all grown up). It was quite funny, although the humour can be a bit rough on the edges, and sometimes overplayed (for example, the sausage fingers was funny maybe the first 3 times, but after ...) The film has references to many films, not just Jackie Chan movies but Indiana Jones, 2001, Ready Player One and maybe even Dark City. Also a reference to the Improbability Drive in Hitch Hiker.
