I recently had my old Leica lenses (some of these are older than me!) cleaned. Decided to go and do bird photography at Nurragingy Reserve, Doonside. These are all taken on the rare Elmar 135mm, introduced in 1960, and still Leica's lightest and best quality 135mm. As you can appreciate, manual focusing on a moving object is rather difficult, so these bird shots were hard to get but well worth it.

We spent a relaxing afternoon at the Nurrangingy Chang Lai Gardens. Usually this place is full of people but thankfully quiet today. Some autumn colours, but not a lot.
