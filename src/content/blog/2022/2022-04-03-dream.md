Wow what a dream: I am attending a Malaysian food festival, in Malaysia. It is a combination of home cooks bringing a dish to share, as well as stalls selling food. I brought along a dish to add to the pool, as well as participated in a group activity to make nasi lemak bungkus (wrapped in banana leaves). The festival has 2 venues, one near KL and another somewhere in a remote area in Pahang. A generous and rich samaritan has provided a set of charter planes to move people across venues. It ended so late I decided to check into a hotel for the night. I was quite proud that I managed not only to book online, but I checked in remotely and the hotel offered a tracking service so I can monitor my luggage arriving into the room whilst I am still at the festival.
