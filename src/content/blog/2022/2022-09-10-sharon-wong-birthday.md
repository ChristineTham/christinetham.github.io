Happy birthday to the sweet and lovable Sharon Wong. We celebrated this joyous occasion with her mother at Bornga Sydney. It just so happens to be the day of the mid autumn festival, so we took the opportunity to parade around Darling Square carrying lighted lanterns. We were popular - everyone kept asking us where we bought them. If we had set up a store, I think we would have done good business. We also met with some Indonesian sailors - I love their tight fitting uniforms!
