I am truly privileged to have been invited to Ee-Vonne Loke's masak masak session featuring Patricia Yong teaching us all how to cook pan mee. The last pan mee I ate was in Penang in 2020 - this version is as good if not better. Had a lot of fun making the dough - I cheated and had Kathleen Pong make most of them for me, and all I did was the final squish and break into smaller pieces. Also featuring red bean and coconut cream for dessert, green mugwort ang ku from Kathleen and Aileen Lim's delicious pandan sponge cake.
