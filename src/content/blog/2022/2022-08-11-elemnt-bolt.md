I decided I liked the Wahoo ELEMNT Roam I bought recently for "Ruby" to
replace the Garmin Edge 510 that I decided to buy another ELEMNT. I bought
the smaller ELEMNT Bolt V2 for "Bliss" (Trek Madone 5 WSD).

I also took the opportunity to reconfigure the handlebar configuration on both
Ruby and Bliss so they matched each other as closely as possible.
