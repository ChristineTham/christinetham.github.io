I bought a strip of char siew from Eastwood yesterday. No, not BBQ One, I went there and wasn't impressed by their selection, so bought from Eastwood Village instead.

I like to buy char siew from a Chinese BBQ shop, but I always ask them not
to slice it, because like to slice it myself.

I warmed it in the oven, then slightly crisped it in the griller but still leaving the meat tender and juicy, then sliced it using a cleaver and placed it on a bed of blanched chinese cabbage. The salted duck egg is not optional - it goes with the char siew really well.

I stir fried some chinese cabbage, and served it with a boiled salted duck egg,
which is typical in some Hong Kong cafes.
