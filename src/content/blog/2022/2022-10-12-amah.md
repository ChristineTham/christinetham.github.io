Delicious lunch at Amah by Ho Jiak organised by Eemie Ong and attended by various ladies. You can choose from 4 mains and 2 sides plus a drink. I had the Kuay Teow Tong plus chicken kerabu salad and Tiger Beer. Many chose to have the famous CKT. We also shared a har mee bomb between us. Great gathering and lots of fun and laughter.
