Listening to another recording of Turandot. This is the iconic 1960 RCA Living Stereo recording featuring Birgit Nilsson, Jussi Byoerling and Renata Tebaldi, with Erich Leinsdorf conducting the Rome Opera House orchestra and chorus.
This set is the original US first run print, several years older than me. I also own the Super Audio CD, but the LP set just sounds so much better, almost as if it was recorded yesterday. The booklet is beautifully illustrated.
This is a marvelous recording from the heyday of audio, with minimal mixing and relying on careful placement of the singers and musicians on stage, long before digital recording and audio compression completely destroyed the industry.
