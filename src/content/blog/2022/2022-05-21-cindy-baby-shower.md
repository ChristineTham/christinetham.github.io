antastic and amazing 🐨🐨🐨BaBy🐨🐨🐨 shower for CinDy Yeoh RaNa at Rita Enar's house. Had so much fun and the food was so good! Afterwards we played a "guess Cindy's waistline" game and also had baby shower bingo. So glad everyone turned up despite the rain. Super thanks to Adeline Lamond and Radika Lee for being the mastermind and organiser, and everyone who helped out either by bringing a dish, preparing the food, decorating the flower and koala wall, setting the table, and cleaning out afterwards. It rained a bit, but not enough to spoil the occasion.
