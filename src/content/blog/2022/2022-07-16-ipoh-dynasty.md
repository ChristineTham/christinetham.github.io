We found a new favourite Malaysian restaurant - Ipoh Dynasty Restaurant 怡保山城. The owners are really from Ipoh and proud of it. Wow, I would rate every dish we tried as 10/10 for taste and authenticity. I mean, check out the home made tim cheung sauce in the chee cheong fun with yong tau foo. And you better believe the other dishes were A1 as well! This is definitely the new No 1 Malaysian restaurant in Campsie, quite possible Sydney.
