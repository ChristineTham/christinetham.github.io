Best $20 I have spent on a meal - Dinner at Ho Jiak Haymarket taking advantage of their Dine voucher promotion. So far I have spent 3 out of my 4 dine vouchers at the 3 Ho Jiak venues - so satisfying each one of them. The food here is a little different from the other venues - loved the steamed egg and steamed barramundi. The salted egg chicken wings were also a winner.
