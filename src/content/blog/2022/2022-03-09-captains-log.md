Captain's log, Stardate 202203.09: it's been raining incessantly, and it's been several days since we sighted dry land. I miss being able to venture on shore and sample the local delights. We ran out of our last can of Ma Ling Pork Luncheon meat a while ago, and have been forced to eat the ship parrot. I shall miss hearing the poor creature recite the Mahabrata.
