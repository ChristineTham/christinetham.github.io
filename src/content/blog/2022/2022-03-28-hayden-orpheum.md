Visited the Hayden Orpheum Picture Palace to watch Drive My Car, the Oscar winning foreign film. Despite the movie's length of 3 hours, I was engrossed from start till finish and my eyes were glued to the screen. The plot is superficially simple, but the film is open-ended, complex and multi layered and can be interpreted in many ways depending on your perspective. My favourite interpretation is that everything in the film is a daydream/fantasy/musings of the driver, based on a book she has read, combined with plays she has seen and a films she has watched, interspersed with elements from her life. The last scene, where she is in a different country and speaks a different language (Korea) and no longer has a scar, is the reality. PS - the "coffee" was great, thanks Margaret Stow for organising.
