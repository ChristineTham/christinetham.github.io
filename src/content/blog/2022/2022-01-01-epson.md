Spent the 1st day of 2020-too cleaning our printer (Epson ET-7750). It has been smearing for a while, but lately can't print in colour. I was about to replace it with a new printer, but I hate throwing away things. Anyway, the culprit is a clogged up print head cleaner. After cleaning it several times using Windex and replacing the maintenance service box, I am happy to report it now prints beautifully. Apparently its a common problem with this printer.
