I finished building "Cadel" - a road bike with an Olmo Kurva frame and Ultegra
groupset plus 3T components, in 2011, on the day Cadel Evans won the Tour
de France. It was my first bicycle built from parts up.

I was going to sell it on Ebay, but decided to resurrect it by changing the
wheels and tyres. I am planning to use it as an indoor training bike connected
to Wahoo KICKR Snap.

However, on Sunday the chain came off and twisted the derailler when I attempted to get off the saddle whilst trying to climb Passio dello Stelvio on RGT Cycling.

I honestly did not think the derailleur was rescueable, but the experts at Cyclery Northside managed to straighten and realign it. The freehub is cracked, so had to replace the rear wheel, and took the opportunity to replace the tyres as well.
