It was a massive effort - we worked till 7:30pm and were exhausted by the end of the day (although I did sneak out in the middle and had a beer I needed it). It was a great bonding moment and we all felt connected to ancient traditions making things the way our grandmothers would have. I now truly appreciate the tremendous amount of effort that goes into making these simple looking but delightful tasting creations.

Sharon Wong's amazing tiger themed yee sang - made as part of yesterday's gotong royong, but fully deserves a post of its own. Best yee sang I have ever tasted, and so pretty!
