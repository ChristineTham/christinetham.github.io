Rainy day is a good day for cleaning LPs.

I have reached the stage in my life where I already own all the LPs I ever wanted, and the few I am missing out on are so rare I have given up.

So I am upgrading albums I already own to try and get better sound quality.

I am onto my third LP of my favourite Carpenters album, The first was a bit muddled and scratchy, the second has slight groove distortion and high surface noise.

This third one, formerly owned by a radio station (2CA) is the best so far. It looks well played, but radio stations tend to have good equipment and take care of their records. Karen's voice really sounds full and luscious on this one, and the vinyl is fairly quiet.
