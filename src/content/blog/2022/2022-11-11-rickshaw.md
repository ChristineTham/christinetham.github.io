We went back to Burwood to have dinner at Rickshaw Food. Originally I was going to try the Singapore hokkien mee or laksa, but we discovered they have a surprisingly reasonably priced buffet menu. We ordered it thinking if the food is bad, we'll just go somewhere else for dessert. But the food turned out to be incredibly good and very generous servings. The beef rendang was superb with kerisik and tender beef chunks, and the assam fish head was amazing. Will definitely come back here again.
