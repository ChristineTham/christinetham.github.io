Thermomix cooking session by Sharon Wong hosted by Margaret Stow. Today's dishes include chicken, lap cheong and mushroom claypot rice, prawns and tong fun in XO sauce, and curry puffs. Kenny was pestering me to give him some curry puffs - wouldn't leave me alone! The surprise of the day was curry puff made using roti canai dough - two of my favourites merged into one!
