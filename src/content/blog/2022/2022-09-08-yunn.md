Great catchup and lunch at Yunn with Adeline Lamond, Cindy Larson and new bestie Eemie Ong. The noodles and grilled tapas style dishes were delicious - the spicy beef noodles in particular reminded me a little bit of Seremban beef noodles. We were so hungry we ordered an extra bowl of the beef noodles but the second bowl had too much Szechuan pepper in it. The desserts were interesting. After that we decided to have afternoon tea with a sundae and takoyaki at Oh Matcha.
