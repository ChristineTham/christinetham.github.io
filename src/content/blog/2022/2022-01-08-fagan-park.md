We were supposed to go yum cha today but it was cancelled as half the group had to isolate. Wow, Omicron is spreading like wildfire - so many people I know have tested positive recently.

Anyway, decided to visit Fagan Park instead. It was very hot and humid, but the Gardens of Many Nations look great!
