## Grumpy Baker

Stopped by at The Grumpy Baker Bilpin to buy some pies, and discovered some murals here, so we dutifully posed in front of them.

## Breenhold

Unfortunately we were too early the trees are still green but we had a long picnic lunch at Breenhold Gardens and then wandered through the gardens.

## St George's Anglican Church

This is a quaint church and a quiet but pretty cemetery. We met another photographer here taking photos of the leaves, and she helped take some photos of us.

## Cathedral of Ferns

Great name for a place, but it's not well signposted. We had problems knowing where to go, asked a group of campers, but they didn't know either, but their dog wanted to follow us. Eventually I think we found it, but it felt a bit creepy so we basically gave up and decided to have afternoon tea.
