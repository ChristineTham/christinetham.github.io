Lyn used to study in the University of New England at Armidale and we have visited it in the 1990s, but since then we have not come back. Post COVID-19 lockdown, we thought it is a great opportunity to come back to this place and see what has changed.

We also visited various other places, including Copeton Dam and a few other dams (Split Rock, Dumaresq and Chaffey), as well as nearby towns Barraba and Uralla. We also visited Tamworth, the country music festival town.

We explored Waterfall Way, and saw Gara Gorge, Wollomombi Falls, Bakers Creek Falls, Dangar Gorge and the very picturesque Gostwyck Chapel.

Finally, we spent a morning at the University of New England campus for nostalgia's sake.
