Weird dream in 3 parts:

Part 1: I am eating some food, and suddenly the food started moving. The meat was deep fried, and yet it started crawling. Scared, I ran out of the house. I noticed it was cold, so I grabbed a bedsheet from the clothes line and wrapped it around myself.

Part 2: Somehow I have run all the way down a country lane, and I am in a house. It turns out to be a Japanese bath house, like in the Studio Ghibli movie Spirited Away. For some reason, my bed sheet wrapped around me was interpreted as a yukata, so I was welcomed. I remember having to strip into my undies to get into a bath, and I was completely submerged in water but still able to walk around on the floor. One of the attendants complimented me on my Japanese, and said I had a lovely accent.

Part 3: I was very far from home, so decided to wait for a bus. I stopped by at a place that turned out to be a university. For some reason, I was expected there as a speaker. I made a tiny speech to a group of students. For some reason they were really impressed and nodded at how wise I was.
