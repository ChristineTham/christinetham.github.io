Today's dream: In my alter ego as Indiana Jones' sister, I managed to find the Holy Grail. It wasn't hard at all, it was just lying on the ground waiting to be picked up. The hard part was filling out all the forms and writing a paper to describe how I found it.

The collection box for the grail has been waiting so long for someone to find it, it has gathered dust and wrapped with sticky tape. I had to break the protective glass, unwrap the tape, wrap the grail in newspaper before sticking it in.
