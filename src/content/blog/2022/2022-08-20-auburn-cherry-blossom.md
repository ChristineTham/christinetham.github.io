Back after a pandemic hiatus, Auburn Botanical Gardens - Cherry Blossom Festival is on again! We got there at 9am and surprisingly there were not too many people so we managed to sneak in some good shots before we were shooed away for the next batch. I actually think we managed to get better shots this year because of the crowd control - in previous years it has been almost impossible to get some shots due to overcrowding. It was also good to pose with Hello Kitty and sample her fairy bread!
