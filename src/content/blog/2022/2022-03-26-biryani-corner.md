We went to Biryani Corner - Sydney for lunch. There was also a Street Fair on. The mutton and chicken biryani were delicious, but I felt it was missing some ingredients (like boiled egg) compared to the last time I was here. The thali was also missing some ingredients but they brought them eventually. We also had more food (including vegetarian korma, Chicken 65, naan, pappadam and rice) but silly me I forgot to take photos.
