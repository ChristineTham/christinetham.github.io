I took the original lead sheet provided in the assignment, then expanded to four parts that are polyrhythmic as well as polyphonic (based on Latin rhythms). I also added separate improvisations for piano and flute. Finally, I added open-voiced string harmonisation in the final section to indicate the guide tones and basis for future improvisation.
