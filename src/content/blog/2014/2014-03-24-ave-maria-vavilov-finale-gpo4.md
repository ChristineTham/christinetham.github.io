The full name of this piece is Неизвестный автор XVI в. (Ave Maria). Often (incorrectly) ascribed to Guilio Caccini, this work was actually composed by Vladimir Fyodorovich Vavilov (Влади́мир Фёдорович Вави́лов) in 1970 and featured in his album &#8220;Lute music of the XVI-XVII cent.&#8221; (Лютневая музыка 16-17 веков) released on the Melodiya label. I have transcribed the melody by listening to the original recording, then harmonised, added counterpoint and arranged it in 12 parts for strings and woodwinds. The notation software is Finale 2014a and the instrumentation is Garritan Personal Orchestra 4. I also used izotope Ozone 5 for final mastering.
