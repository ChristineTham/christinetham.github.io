## Birth

![Modern Klang](/images/about/Klang.jpg)

I was born on 8 August 1964 in Klang General Hospital (now renamed to Hospital
Tengku Ampuan
Rahimah). Klang is a royal city and former capital of the state of Selangor,
Malaysia. Port Klang is the 12th busiest container port in the world
(according to [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klang_(city)>)).

My father was a land surveyor attached to the Survey Department of Malaysia.
Every few years, he will get posted to a different city. So I did not get a
chance to stay in Klang long, because soon after we moved to Kuala Terengganu.

According to my mum, there is an interesting story connected to my stay here
when I was about 1 year old.

We moved to a rented house and the rent was apparently surprisingly affordable.
However, I would wake up every night crying at around 11pm. No matter what my
mother did, she could not calm me down. She said a neighbour then told them
the previous occupant was apparently stabbed and murdered at 11pm. After that
my parents decided to move elsewhere and I stopped waking up at 11pm.

## Penang

We then moved to Penang when I was about 2-3 years old. My brother was born in
Penang. My earliest childhoold memories were of my brother's birth. I was in
the car with Grandma whilst my father went up to the hospital to see mum. For
some reason, I was not allowed to go and I was very annoyed. It was stifling
hot. I kept crying and demanded to be allowed to witness my brother's birth.
My Grandma could not calm me down.

Finally my mother gave birth. According to my parents, my father proudly held
out my brother so that I could see him from the window of the ward in the
hospital.

Another early memory was my Grandma painting my nails red. I was so proud I
rushed out and showed my nails to all my friends.

## Taiping

![Taiping Lake Gardens](/images/about/Taiping.jpg)

We moved to Taiping for a brief period when I was in kindergarten, just before
I started primary school. Taiping was an old tin mining town that developed
in the 19th century when tin was discovered there. The original mining ground
was converted to become the Lake Garden, the first public garden established
during the British rule in Malaya.

Taiping is nestled in a valley between mountains, and the unique geography
collects moisture from clouds and results in rain nearly every afternoon.
Taiping is the wettest town in Malaysia. As a result, the Lake Garden is
stunningly beautiful and green.

Taiping is probably my favourite town in Malaysia. When we first moved in,
we had temporary accommodation in one of the old colonial houses originally
built by the British. It's a large crumbling house with a really old tree in
the courtyard. I loved that house - I used to explore it and it was a
fascinating place. I still dream about the house.

However, we soon moved to a more modest bungalow on the outskirts of town.
Behind us was the jungle. My mum said snakes used to make a home in the
storage room and garage.

Once I was peddling along in my toy motorcar down our driveway. According to
my mum, a very large snake crawled across the driveway. I patiently waited for
the snake to finish crossing the driveway, then proceeded along as if nothing
unusual has happened.

I remember getting a picture book of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and it was my
favourite book. I was fascinated by the coloured pictures in it. I took it
everywhere with me. One day, we parked the car at the Lake Garden for an
afternoon stroll. Of course, I had the book with me. I left it on the roof
to tie my shoes, then forgot about it completely, so when the car drove off,
I lost the book. I cried for a long time and to this date still miss the book.

## Kuala Kangsar

![Kuala Kangsar home](/images/about/kk.jpg)

I started primary school in Taiping but we soon moved to Kuala Kangsar, the
royal town of Perak, Malaysia, where the Sultan of Perak has a palace.

I completed most of my primary school here. We lived in a tiny Malay village
called Kampung Talang. As far as I remember, we were the only non-Malay and
non-Muslim family there. A mosque was directly behind our house, so I was
used to the call to prayer blasting from PA speakers 5 times a day.

My brother and I made many friends here. I remember we would pretend to be
part of the crew of Star Trek and had many fantastic adventures with our
friends. We also played marbles.

I had a Raleigh three speed bicycle. I loved cycling and used to cycle through
the paths of the village. One day, I crashed into a fence whilst racing with
someone. Although I did not break any bones, I destroyed the bicycle and had
a very big hole in my right arm and there is a massive scar there to this day.
Sadly, my parents forbade me from cycling again and did not buy another bicycle.
I ended up not cycling again until my 40s.

My appendix burst when I was 7, and I had to be rushed to hospital for
emergency surgery. The surgeon was a friend of my father, and by all accounts
the surgery was successful. I was hospitalised in bed for nearly two weeks,
and to my shock and horror, I discovered I had lost the ability to walk and
had to relearn.

According to my mum, I had a friend in the royal family who went to school
with me. My parents used to drop me off at the Royal Palace in the afternoons
after school so that I can play with my friend. I don't remember any of this.

I also discovered much later that my father was a friend of the Sultan and
a member of the sultanate's tennis team. He has played tennis for the Sultan
in several interstate tournaments, and was frequently invited to the sultan's
many parties. According to my mum, my primary school teacher used to flirt
with him at those parties.

Kuala Kangsar was when I started becoming interested in music and high fidelity\
audio systems. My Dad was an avid audiophile who would regularly visit Penang
to buy the latest gear, and he has upgraded his system many times. I used to
come along with him, so I gradually learnt all the finer details of
turntables, amplifiers and speakers. I was the only one my father entrusted to
use the system, so I was charged with all the maintenance - cleaning the
records, calibrating the turntable speed and arm alignment, and replacing a
blown valve tube.

I remember my father started with a Thorens turntable, but upgraded to a
futuristic looking Transcriptors Hydraulic Reference Turntable (a design so
unique it was used as a prop in the Stanley Kubrick film "A Clockwork Orange").
In practice, the turntable was incredibly finicky and had to be aligned and
adjusted almost before each use.

I started having a real appreciation for various kinds of music. When the
quadrophonic craze swept through the late 1970s, my father invested not only
in a fully configured quad system, but he had multiple units capable of
decoding not just one Quad format, but three different ones:

- JVC's CD4 system (the only discrete quadrophonic system where the rear
  channels are frequency modulated with a 30kHz carrier and a special Shibata
  stylus that can track ultrasonic frequencies is required in the turntable),
- The SQ system promoted by Columbia Records
- The QS system promoted by Sansui

I also started playing music, by learning the classical guitar, and also the
mellodion. I was the melodionist in the school band and remember performing
in school concerts. I also started composing music, mainly on the guitar.

I also became an avid reader in Kuala Kangsar. My mum used to buy me Enid
Blyton books when I was young, and I was addicted to the Secret Seven, and
later on Famous Five books. When I accompanied my father to visit Penang on
his many audiophile trips, I would spend time at the second hand bookshops
on the beach and bought many books there.

I stayed at my aunt's room for several weeks during one school
vacation when I was living with my grandma. She had gone to the UK to study.
I discovered she had a whole bookshelf full of romance novels, primarily
Mills and Book but also some Harlequin. I devoured her entire bookshelf, and
read a few other books as well.

## Seremban

![Bukit Rasah home](/images/about/bukitrasah.jpg)

In my last year of primary school, my parents finally moved back to their
hometown, Seremban. I finished my primary school here and enrolled in the same
school as the one my father attended, the King George V School, or KGV as
the locals call it.

![King George V school](/images/about/kgv.jpg)

KGV is one of the top schools in Malaysia, and had facilities that few
schools had. It had its own full sized athletics ground located across Birch
Rd (a major road). There was a special tunnel underneath the road connecting the
field to the main school buildings. The school was also unique in that it
featured a swimming pool, something that very few schools in Malaysia would
have had.

In my father's day, the school was staffed by British teachers who were Oxford
and Cambridge educated. Strong ties to the British legacy still existed during
my time there and the school had rugby and cricket teams. In my father's time,
it would have been a boys school but in my time it was one of the few
premier schools in Malaysia that was co-educational.

In Seremban, I continued my book reading habit and typically read one book a
day. I borrowed books not only from the school library but also from the library
at the Sungei Ujong Club which my father was a member of. I became addicted to
Agatha Christie mysteries, discovered science fiction and soon became
addicted to all the "masters": Isaac Asimov, arthur C Clarke, Robert Heinlein
etc.

I studied in KGV for 6 years, became the school monitor in Form 6, and the
editor of the school magazine.

## I, Nerd

![HP67](/images/about/HP67.jpg)

I became interested in calculators and computers during my high school. I
remember my Dad bringing home an HP calculator that the department was
evaluating home with him. It was the HP 67, an advanced programmable
scientific calculator that stored programs on a magnetic strip.

I was totally fascinated by the idea of programming a machine to execute a
sequence of calculation steps automatically. I devoured the operating manual
and taught myself how to program. The HP salesman visiting my father was
impressed and left me with a few copies of the HP Calculator Journal.

My father then took home another calculator, the TI 59. I managed to program
it to do traverse survey computations based on a geodesy textbook my father
lent me, and my father was impressed enough to use it at work.

I started hearing about computers in the late 1970s. The Apple ][ was probably
the most popular personal computer that had just been released, and my father
borrowed one for me to play with. I also read the manual from cover to cover
and was fascinated with the machine. Unfortunately, my father couldn't afford
to buy me an Apple, so he bought a second hand Tandy TRS-80 instead.

Still, I managed to learn a lot from the TRS-80. I taught myself how to program
not only in BASIC but Z-80 assembly language.

## Academic progress

I wasn't a spectacular student in my early years. I wasn't that interested in
studying. I had reasonable grades, enough to place me in the top class, but
I was probably an average student in that class.

Sometime after Form 3, I discovered the ability to recall information almost
perfectly. It started when I was studying for an exam whilst on a holiday
with my family at Port Dickson. I discovered a technique where if I associate
something with a page of writing - a smell, or a colour, or some memory
fragment, I can then recall everything on that page almost as if it was right
in front of me.

This made it easy for me to memorise lots of text, and my grades
improved spectacularly. Suddenly, without much additional effort on my part, I
became the top student in the class, earning almost perfect marks in nearly
every subject. I was also a good problem solver, which
helped me in mathematical and scientific subjects.

Indeed, I was so good at one stage my teachers suspected me of cheating. My
mother was called in to school, I was forced to resit an exam under close
supervision, but I managed to prove I could reproduce entire class notes and
lessons without too much effort.

I did really well in the Malaysian Certificate of Education (MCE) exams,
which all Form 5 students had to sit. The exam is very important, and either
guaranteed students a place in
Form 6 and subsequently university, or determined what their likely future in
life would be when they leave school.

Not only was I the top scorer in my school, but in the whole state of Negeri
Sembilan and rumours had it I was placed 3rd or 4th nationally. Newspaper
journalists were trying to interview me but my parents whisked me away safely.

I think it was around that time my parents decided they should send me to
Australia to complete my high school and university.
