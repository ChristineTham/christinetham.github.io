I first did a personal web site in the 1990s - it's mainly an online resume, and
I think it was created in pure HTML without any CSS or Javascript, and uploaded
via FTP to my dial up internet service provider (I don't think they exist any
more).

I remember it was hard to edit HTML using a text editor. In 1996 Microsoft
acquired a company called Vermeer and launched FrontPage, a WYSIWYG HTML editor
that made editing web pages almost as easy as using a word processor. I liked
the concept, except the HTML generated by FrontPage was really ugly and full
of non standard markups.

A year later, Macromedia (since acquired by Adobe)
launched a product called Dreamweaver, which allowed you to edit vanilla HTML
but has a preview feature that lets you see what the rendered result would
look like in real time. It also checks the HTML for errors and highlighted
the code. It's the precursor of the modern web editor/IDE.

I really liked Dreamweaver, but never had time to create a website on it. It
was still too hard to create HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

In the 2000s I created a few websites on
[Google Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/), notably a travelogue of my
[Lord of the Rings New Zealand Tour 2004](https://nzlotr.blogspot.com)
and my [Trip to Japan 2008](https://japan08.blogspot.com).

Blogger made it easy to create websites without using HTML. But I would have
liked more flexibility and the ability to create my own design rather than
using one of the pre-existing themes.

Also in the 2000s, web content management systems became increasingly
prevalent. These systems not only provided an environment for creating web
sites without using HTML, but they managed the entire process including
approvale workflows, provided access control for authors and viewers, and
stored the web content in a backend database, which allowed dynamic
functionality.

The most widely used web content management system today is
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org). I started creating websites in WordPress
around 2016 or so. I liked the ease of use and flexibility of WordPress, and
the rich ecosystem of themes and plugins. It seemed like I could almost do
anything in WordPress.

However, WordPress requires a server to run, which I can either deploy myself
or use a hosting provider. I started by using
[HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com) which offered cheap hosting plans and
unlimited storage, but I discovered they were slow. I ended up deploying my
own server running [Plesk](https://www.plesk.com) on
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic when much of the world was in lockdown,
I decided to finally learn modern web development. I had been trying to avoid
it my entire life, because I hated Javascript. I tried looking at alternatives:
Python with Django or Flask, Go, ASP.NET and C#, F#, but at the end of the day
everyone I spoke to just said "Suck it up, and just learn Javascript."

Even with technologies like WASM, which is in theory allow you to write in
any language you like (provided it can be compiled into WASM code), standard
HTML, CSS and Javascript is still the best way to create a web site. It has
the richest ecosystem and the broadest browser support, and fastest load times.
In these days when Google is starting to rank websites based on their
performance, that actually mattered.

So what exactly is modern web development? It's basically HTML, CSS and
Javascript but augmented with web and UI frameworks and modern build tools
and development environments. Progressive Web Applications written in JQuery
and AngularJS was popular 5 years ago, but now its static site generation,
serverless hosting and backend microservices and APIs.

I started off by learning [React](https://reactjs.org), and using UI frameworks
like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io). Then
I experimented with static and dynamic site builders like
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org).

I built several websites using Gatsby and NextJS, but ultimately both are
quite complex and hard to build in. It was difficult to integrate vanilla JS
packages into them, there is a lot of work to build a fully functioning blog
site.

Frustrated, I started going back to basics and playing with static site
generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
These allowed me to create websites using vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Imagine, the very thing I was trying to avoid (writing raw HTML, CSS etc.)
turned out to be easier and simpler than any other option. But Jekyll and Hugo
were also quite cumbersome to use, requiring mastery over a moustached
templating language which always end up limiting and frustrating for me.

The current version of this website is written in a brand new Javascript based
static site generator and framework called [Astro](https://astro.build) -
Version 1.0.0 was released on 9 August 2022. I started by creating a prototype
in Jekyll and Bootstrap, then a functional pilot usin Hugo. When I discovered
Astro, I realise how powerful and easy to use it was, and managed to write
most of the code that powers this website (excluding content) in less than
1 month.
