My great grandfather was Tam Yong (father of towkay Tan Yee Man), Kapitan China of Seremban. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapitan_Cina):

> Kapitan Cina, also spelled Kapitan China or Capitan China (English: Captain of the Chinese; Chinese: 華人甲必丹; pinyin: Huárén Jiǎbìdān; Dutch: Kapitein der Chinezen), was a high-ranking government position in the civil administration of colonial Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Borneo and the Philippines. Office holders exercised varying degrees of power and influence: from near-sovereign political and legal jurisdiction over local Chinese communities, to ceremonial precedence for community leaders.

I am greatly indebted to the [森美蘭譚氏聯宗會 The N.S. Tham Clansmen Association](https://tamclansmen.blogspot.com/2009/06/history-of-kapitan-tham-yong.html) for providing information about my great grandfather.

## Birthplace

My great grandfather originated from the Dragon Mouth Village of Changsha Township by Kaiping District in the Province of GuangDong. A genealogy expert has helped locate it for me. Changsha is an island - it looks like this today on Apple maps.

## Extract from "Twentieth Century Impressions of British Malaya"

Extract from the book "Twentieth Century Impressions of British Malaya" - an entry about my great grandfather. Thank you to Jack Tham for sending this to me. What is totally amazing is I remember the house in the picture!!! Visited it as a small child. Demolished to make way for the KL Seremban freeway exit to present day Seremban.

### Towkay Tam Yong

The fact that Towkay Tam Yong has for many years represented Chinese interests in the State Council of the Negri Sambilan testifies to the high esteem in which he is held. A native of Canton, he came to the Federated Malay States some thirty-three years ago and joined a relative who had already established himself in business in that country. His father was a merchant in the Kwangtung Province of China and member of a well-known family in the Two Kwang. During his early stay in the Negri Sambilan, Mr. Tam Yong was very successful as a merchant. Subsequently he purchased land and planted it as a coffee estate. Later on he became proprietor of a brick-kiln, and undertook several important Government contracts, amongst which was the building of the gaol at Seremban. Mr. Tam Yong, whose home is in Seremban, became a member of the State Council in 1898, and at present is the only Chinese member of that body. Most of his business concerns now are in the Negri Sambilan. He has six sons and six daughters. His eldest son was educated in Singapore.

## Epitaph

The following is taken from an epitaph erected by The N.S. Tham Clansmen Association:

Today, there is a street named after my great grandfather. Jalan Kapitan Tam Yeong is a road on the northern part of downtown Seremban (formerly part of Murray St). It connects Jalan Tun Dr Ismail to Jalan Leftenan Adnan. In between, it also forms junctions with Jalan Dato Bandar Tunggal, Jalan Seng Meng Lee and Jalan Yam Tuan.
