This website is written in [Astro](https://astro.build) as the static site
generator and framework and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) as the
CSS utility framework.

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
as the development environment.

Credit goes to [Undraw](https://undraw.co/) for the illustrations and to
[Freepik](https://www.freepik.com) for the Kawaii Flat icon designs.

The code for the website is open source (MIT licence) and available in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ChristineTham/christinetham.github.io).

The website is published on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) using a
custom domain [christham.net](https://christham.net).

The current version of the website is completely static, but I plan to add
dynamic features in the future. I may host the website on a platform like
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
but the source code will always be publicly available.

I hope the website will continue to exist beyond my lifetime, and making it
open sourced and hosted on a serverless platform hopefully will help me meet
that goal.
