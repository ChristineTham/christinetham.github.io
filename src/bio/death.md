No, I am not quite dead yet. But like all living things, eventually I will, and
I like to be prepared for that eventuality.

To quote Pink Floyd from "The Great Gig in the Sky" (from the album "Dark Side
of the Moon"):

> And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I don't mind.  
> Why should I be frightened of dying?  
> There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime.
>
> I never said I was frightened of dying.

I like to think I've lived out each day to the fullest, and if I die then
I have accomplished as much as I could in this lifetime, and I look forward
to the next adventure, if there is one.

One of the reasons for me to create this website, and making it open source,
is that I hope the website will survive my death, and even though I may not
be remembered, at least there is some document of what I have lived through.
