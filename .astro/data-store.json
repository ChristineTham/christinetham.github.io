Klang is a royal city and former capital of the state of Selangor,\nMalaysia. Port Klang is the 12th busiest container port in the world\n(according to [Wikipedia](\u003Chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klang_(city)>)).\n\nMy father was a land surveyor attached to the Survey Department of Malaysia.\nEvery few years, he will get posted to a different city. So I did not get a\nchance to stay in Klang long, because soon after we moved to Kuala Terengganu.\n\nAccording to my mum, there is an interesting story connected to my stay here\nwhen I was about 1 year old.\n\nWe moved to a rented house and the rent was apparently surprisingly affordable.\nHowever, I would wake up every night crying at around 11pm. No matter what my\nmother did, she could not calm me down. She said a neighbour then told them\nthe previous occupant was apparently stabbed and murdered at 11pm. After that\nmy parents decided to move elsewhere and I stopped waking up at 11pm.\n\n## Penang\n\n![Chew Jetty](/images/about/Penang.jpg)\n\nWe then moved to Penang when I was about 2-3 years old. My brother was born in\nPenang. My earliest childhoold memories were of my brother's birth. I was in\nthe car with Grandma whilst my father went up to the hospital to see mum. For\nsome reason, I was not allowed to go and I was very annoyed. It was stifling\nhot. I kept crying and demanded to be allowed to witness my brother's birth.\nMy Grandma could not calm me down.\n\nFinally my mother gave birth. According to my parents, my father proudly held\nout my brother so that I could see him from the window of the ward in the\nhospital.\n\nAnother early memory was my Grandma painting my nails red. I was so proud I\nrushed out and showed my nails to all my friends.\n\n## Taiping\n\n![Taiping Lake Gardens](/images/about/Taiping.jpg)\n\nWe moved to Taiping for a brief period when I was in kindergarten, just before\nI started primary school. Taiping was an old tin mining town that developed\nin the 19th century when tin was discovered there. The original mining ground\nwas converted to become the Lake Garden, the first public garden established\nduring the British rule in Malaya.\n\nTaiping is nestled in a valley between mountains, and the unique geography\ncollects moisture from clouds and results in rain nearly every afternoon.\nTaiping is the wettest town in Malaysia. As a result, the Lake Garden is\nstunningly beautiful and green.\n\nTaiping is probably my favourite town in Malaysia. When we first moved in,\nwe had temporary accommodation in one of the old colonial houses originally\nbuilt by the British. It's a large crumbling house with a really old tree in\nthe courtyard. I loved that house - I used to explore it and it was a\nfascinating place. I still dream about the house.\n\nHowever, we soon moved to a more modest bungalow on the outskirts of town.\nBehind us was the jungle. My mum said snakes used to make a home in the\nstorage room and garage.\n\nOnce I was peddling along in my toy motorcar down our driveway. According to\nmy mum, a very large snake crawled across the driveway. I patiently waited for\nthe snake to finish crossing the driveway, then proceeded along as if nothing\nunusual has happened.\n\nI remember getting a picture book of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and it was my\nfavourite book. I was fascinated by the coloured pictures in it. I took it\neverywhere with me. One day, we parked the car at the Lake Garden for an\nafternoon stroll. Of course, I had the book with me. I left it on the roof\nto tie my shoes, then forgot about it completely, so when the car drove off,\nI lost the book. I cried for a long time and to this date still miss the book.\n\n## Kuala Kangsar\n\n![Kuala Kangsar home](/images/about/kk.jpg)\n\nI started primary school in Taiping but we soon moved to Kuala Kangsar, the\nroyal town of Perak, Malaysia, where the Sultan of Perak has a palace.\n\nI completed most of my primary school here. We lived in a tiny Malay village\ncalled Kampung Talang. As far as I remember, we were the only non-Malay and\nnon-Muslim family there. A mosque was directly behind our house, so I was\nused to the call to prayer blasting from PA speakers 5 times a day.\n\nMy brother and I made many friends here. I remember we would pretend to be\npart of the crew of Star Trek and had many fantastic adventures with our\nfriends. We also played marbles.\n\nI had a Raleigh three speed bicycle. I loved cycling and used to cycle through\nthe paths of the village. One day, I crashed into a fence whilst racing with\nsomeone. Although I did not break any bones, I destroyed the bicycle and had\na very big hole in my right arm and there is a massive scar there to this day.\nSadly, my parents forbade me from cycling again and did not buy another bicycle.\nI ended up not cycling again until my 40s.\n\nMy appendix burst when I was 7, and I had to be rushed to hospital for\nemergency surgery. The surgeon was a friend of my father, and by all accounts\nthe surgery was successful. I was hospitalised in bed for nearly two weeks,\nand to my shock and horror, I discovered I had lost the ability to walk and\nhad to relearn.\n\nAccording to my mum, I had a friend in the royal family who went to school\nwith me. My parents used to drop me off at the Royal Palace in the afternoons\nafter school so that I can play with my friend. I don't remember any of this.\n\nI also discovered much later that my father was a friend of the Sultan and\na member of the sultanate's tennis team. He has played tennis for the Sultan\nin several interstate tournaments, and was frequently invited to the sultan's\nmany parties. According to my mum, my primary school teacher used to flirt\nwith him at those parties.\n\nKuala Kangsar was when I started becoming interested in music and high fidelity\\\naudio systems. My Dad was an avid audiophile who would regularly visit Penang\nto buy the latest gear, and he has upgraded his system many times. I used to\ncome along with him, so I gradually learnt all the finer details of\nturntables, amplifiers and speakers. I was the only one my father entrusted to\nuse the system, so I was charged with all the maintenance - cleaning the\nrecords, calibrating the turntable speed and arm alignment, and replacing a\nblown valve tube.\n\nI remember my father started with a Thorens turntable, but upgraded to a\nfuturistic looking Transcriptors Hydraulic Reference Turntable (a design so\nunique it was used as a prop in the Stanley Kubrick film \"A Clockwork Orange\").\nIn practice, the turntable was incredibly finicky and had to be aligned and\nadjusted almost before each use.\n\nI started having a real appreciation for various kinds of music. When the\nquadrophonic craze swept through the late 1970s, my father invested not only\nin a fully configured quad system, but he had multiple units capable of\ndecoding not just one Quad format, but three different ones:\n\n- JVC's CD4 system (the only discrete quadrophonic system where the rear\n  channels are frequency modulated with a 30kHz carrier and a special Shibata\n  stylus that can track ultrasonic frequencies is required in the turntable),\n- The SQ system promoted by Columbia Records\n- The QS system promoted by Sansui\n\nI also started playing music, by learning the classical guitar, and also the\nmellodion. I was the melodionist in the school band and remember performing\nin school concerts. I also started composing music, mainly on the guitar.\n\nI also became an avid reader in Kuala Kangsar. My mum used to buy me Enid\nBlyton books when I was young, and I was addicted to the Secret Seven, and\nlater on Famous Five books. When I accompanied my father to visit Penang on\nhis many audiophile trips, I would spend time at the second hand bookshops\non the beach and bought many books there.\n\nI stayed at my aunt's room for several weeks during one school\nvacation when I was living with my grandma. She had gone to the UK to study.\nI discovered she had a whole bookshelf full of romance novels, primarily\nMills and Book but also some Harlequin. I devoured her entire bookshelf, and\nread a few other books as well.\n\n## Seremban\n\n![Bukit Rasah home](/images/about/bukitrasah.jpg)\n\nIn my last year of primary school, my parents finally moved back to their\nhometown, Seremban. I finished my primary school here and enrolled in the same\nschool as the one my father attended, the King George V School, or KGV as\nthe locals call it.\n\n![King George V school](/images/about/kgv.jpg)\n\nKGV is one of the top schools in Malaysia, and had facilities that few\nschools had. It had its own full sized athletics ground located across Birch\nRd (a major road). There was a special tunnel underneath the road connecting the\nfield to the main school buildings. The school was also unique in that it\nfeatured a swimming pool, something that very few schools in Malaysia would\nhave had.\n\nIn my father's day, the school was staffed by British teachers who were Oxford\nand Cambridge educated. Strong ties to the British legacy still existed during\nmy time there and the school had rugby and cricket teams. In my father's time,\nit would have been a boys school but in my time it was one of the few\npremier schools in Malaysia that was co-educational.\n\nIn Seremban, I continued my book reading habit and typically read one book a\nday. I borrowed books not only from the school library but also from the library\nat the Sungei Ujong Club which my father was a member of. I became addicted to\nAgatha Christie mysteries, discovered science fiction and soon became\naddicted to all the \"masters\": Isaac Asimov, arthur C Clarke, Robert Heinlein\netc.\n\nI studied in KGV for 6 years, became the school monitor in Form 6, and the\neditor of the school magazine.\n\n## I, Nerd\n\n![HP67](/images/about/HP67.jpg)\n\nI became interested in calculators and computers during my high school. I\nremember my Dad bringing home an HP calculator that the department was\nevaluating home with him. It was the HP 67, an advanced programmable\nscientific calculator that stored programs on a magnetic strip.\n\nI was totally fascinated by the idea of programming a machine to execute a\nsequence of calculation steps automatically. I devoured the operating manual\nand taught myself how to program. The HP salesman visiting my father was\nimpressed and left me with a few copies of the HP Calculator Journal.\n\nMy father then took home another calculator, the TI 59. I managed to program\nit to do traverse survey computations based on a geodesy textbook my father\nlent me, and my father was impressed enough to use it at work.\n\nI started hearing about computers in the late 1970s. The Apple ][ was probably\nthe most popular personal computer that had just been released, and my father\nborrowed one for me to play with. I also read the manual from cover to cover\nand was fascinated with the machine. Unfortunately, my father couldn't afford\nto buy me an Apple, so he bought a second hand Tandy TRS-80 instead.\n\nStill, I managed to learn a lot from the TRS-80. I taught myself how to program\nnot only in BASIC but Z-80 assembly language.\n\n## Academic progress\n\nI wasn't a spectacular student in my early years. I wasn't that interested in\nstudying. I had reasonable grades, enough to place me in the top class, but\nI was probably an average student in that class.\n\nSometime after Form 3, I discovered the ability to recall information almost\nperfectly. It started when I was studying for an exam whilst on a holiday\nwith my family at Port Dickson. I discovered a technique where if I associate\nsomething with a page of writing - a smell, or a colour, or some memory\nfragment, I can then recall everything on that page almost as if it was right\nin front of me.\n\nThis made it easy for me to memorise lots of text, and my grades\nimproved spectacularly. Suddenly, without much additional effort on my part, I\nbecame the top student in the class, earning almost perfect marks in nearly\nevery subject. I was also a good problem solver, which\nhelped me in mathematical and scientific subjects.\n\nIndeed, I was so good at one stage my teachers suspected me of cheating. My\nmother was called in to school, I was forced to resit an exam under close\nsupervision, but I managed to prove I could reproduce entire class notes and\nlessons without too much effort.\n\nI did really well in the Malaysian Certificate of Education (MCE) exams,\nwhich all Form 5 students had to sit. The exam is very important, and either\nguaranteed students a place in\nForm 6 and subsequently university, or determined what their likely future in\nlife would be when they leave school.\n\nNot only was I the top scorer in my school, but in the whole state of Negeri\nSembilan and rumours had it I was placed 3rd or 4th nationally. Newspaper\njournalists were trying to interview me but my parents whisked me away safely.\n\nI think it was around that time my parents decided they should send me to\nAustralia to complete my high school and university.","src/content/bio/childhood.md","35b58fc9c05c8dfc",{"html":88,"metadata":89},"\u003Ch2 id=\"birth\">Birth\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/about/Klang.jpg\" alt=\"Modern Klang\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was born on 8 August 1964 in Klang General Hospital (now renamed to Hospital\nTengku Ampuan\nRahimah).

When the\nquadrophonic craze swept through the late 1970s, my father invested not only\nin a fully configured quad system, but he had multiple units capable of\ndecoding not just one Quad format, but three different ones:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>JVC’s CD4 system (the only discrete quadrophonic system where the rear\nchannels are frequency modulated with a 30kHz carrier and a special Shibata\nstylus that can track ultrasonic frequencies is required in the turntable),\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The SQ system promoted by Columbia Records\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The QS system promoted by Sansui\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>I also started playing music, by learning the classical guitar, and also the\nmellodion. I was the melodionist in the school band and remember performing\nin school concerts. I also started composing music, mainly on the guitar.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I also became an avid reader in Kuala Kangsar. My mum used to buy me Enid\nBlyton books when I was young, and I was addicted to the Secret Seven, and\nlater on Famous Five books. When I accompanied my father to visit Penang on\nhis many audiophile trips, I would spend time at the second hand bookshops\non the beach and bought many books there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I stayed at my aunt’s room for several weeks during one school\nvacation when I was living with my grandma. She had gone to the UK to study.\nI discovered she had a whole bookshelf full of romance novels, primarily\nMills and Book but also some Harlequin. I devoured her entire bookshelf, and\nread a few other books as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"seremban\">Seremban\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/about/bukitrasah.jpg\" alt=\"Bukit Rasah home\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In my last year of primary school, my parents finally moved back to their\nhometown, Seremban. I finished my primary school here and enrolled in the same\nschool as the one my father attended, the King George V School, or KGV as\nthe locals call it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/about/kgv.jpg\" alt=\"King George V school\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>KGV is one of the top schools in Malaysia, and had facilities that few\nschools had. It had its own full sized athletics ground located across Birch\nRd (a major road). There was a special tunnel underneath the road connecting the\nfield to the main school buildings. The school was also unique in that it\nfeatured a swimming pool, something that very few schools in Malaysia would\nhave had.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In my father’s day, the school was staffed by British teachers who were Oxford\nand Cambridge educated. Strong ties to the British legacy still existed during\nmy time there and the school had rugby and cricket teams. In my father’s time,\nit would have been a boys school but in my time it was one of the few\npremier schools in Malaysia that was co-educational.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In Seremban, I continued my book reading habit and typically read one book a\nday. I borrowed books not only from the school library but also from the library\nat the Sungei Ujong Club which my father was a member of. I became addicted to\nAgatha Christie mysteries, discovered science fiction and soon became\naddicted to all the “masters”: Isaac Asimov, arthur C Clarke, Robert Heinlein\netc.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I studied in KGV for 6 years, became the school monitor in Form 6, and the\neditor of the school magazine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"i-nerd\">I, Nerd\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/about/HP67.jpg\" alt=\"HP67\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I became interested in calculators and computers during my high school. I\nremember my Dad bringing home an HP calculator that the department was\nevaluating home with him. It was the HP 67, an advanced programmable\nscientific calculator that stored programs on a magnetic strip.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was totally fascinated by the idea of programming a machine to execute a\nsequence of calculation steps automatically. I devoured the operating manual\nand taught myself how to program. The HP salesman visiting my father was\nimpressed and left me with a few copies of the HP Calculator Journal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My father then took home another calculator, the TI 59. I managed to program\nit to do traverse survey computations based on a geodesy textbook my father\nlent me, and my father was impressed enough to use it at work.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I started hearing about computers in the late 1970s. The Apple ][ was probably\nthe most popular personal computer that had just been released, and my father\nborrowed one for me to play with. I also read the manual from cover to cover\nand was fascinated with the machine. Unfortunately, my father couldn’t afford\nto buy me an Apple, so he bought a second hand Tandy TRS-80 instead.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Still, I managed to learn a lot from the TRS-80. I taught myself how to program\nnot only in BASIC but Z-80 assembly language.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"academic-progress\">Academic progress\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I wasn’t a spectacular student in my early years. I wasn’t that interested in\nstudying. I had reasonable grades, enough to place me in the top class, but\nI was probably an average student in that class.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sometime after Form 3, I discovered the ability to recall information almost\nperfectly. It started when I was studying for an exam whilst on a holiday\nwith my family at Port Dickson. I discovered a technique where if I associate\nsomething with a page of writing - a smell, or a colour, or some memory\nfragment, I can then recall everything on that page almost as if it was right\nin front of me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This made it easy for me to memorise lots of text, and my grades\nimproved spectacularly. Suddenly, without much additional effort on my part, I\nbecame the top student in the class, earning almost perfect marks in nearly\nevery subject. I was also a good problem solver, which\nhelped me in mathematical and scientific subjects.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Indeed, I was so good at one stage my teachers suspected me of cheating. My\nmother was called in to school, I was forced to resit an exam under close\nsupervision, but I managed to prove I could reproduce entire class notes and\nlessons without too much effort.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I did really well in the Malaysian Certificate of Education (MCE) exams,\nwhich all Form 5 students had to sit. The exam is very important, and either\nguaranteed students a place in\nForm 6 and subsequently university, or determined what their likely future in\nlife would be when they leave school.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not only was I the top scorer in my school, but in the whole state of Negeri\nSembilan and rumours had it I was placed 3rd or 4th nationally. Newspaper\njournalists were trying to interview me but my parents whisked me away safely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it was around that time my parents decided they should send me to\nAustralia to complete my high school and university.\u003C/p>",{"headings":90,"imagePaths":112,"frontmatter":113},[91,94,97,100,103,106,109],{"depth":60,"slug":92,"text":93},"birth","Birth",{"depth":60,"slug":95,"text":96},"penang","Penang",{"depth":60,"slug":98,"text":99},"taiping","Taiping",{"depth":60,"slug":101,"text":102},"kuala-kangsar","Kuala Kangsar",{"depth":60,"slug":104,"text":105},"seremban","Seremban",{"depth":60,"slug":107,"text":108},"i-nerd","I, Nerd",{"depth":60,"slug":110,"text":111},"academic-progress","Academic progress",[],{"section":80,"title":82,"description":83,"weight":81,"minutesRead":114,"extra":115},"12 min read",[],"current",{"id":116,"data":118,"body":123,"filePath":124,"digest":125,"rendered":126},{"section":119,"weight":120,"title":121,"description":122},"This Website",910,"Current Design","Design of this web site","This website is written in [Astro](https://astro.build) as the static site\ngenerator and framework and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) as the\nCSS utility framework.\n\nI use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)\nas the development environment.\n\nCredit goes to [Undraw](https://undraw.co/) for the illustrations and to\n[Freepik](https://www.freepik.com) for the Kawaii Flat icon designs.\n\nThe code for the website is open source (MIT licence) and available in a\n[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ChristineTham/christinetham.github.io).\n\nThe website is published on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) using a\ncustom domain [christham.net](https://christham.net).\n\nThe current version of the website is completely static, but I plan to add\ndynamic features in the future.

He was the grandson of Kapitan Tam Yeong, a successful tin miner who founded Seremban (now the capital of Negeri Sembilan) and was appointed the Chinese Captain by the British (leader of the Chinese community).\n\nHis early childhood was a life of privilege, living in a grand mansion and estate on the outskirts of Seremban. His mother (my grandmother) was an imported bride from a high ranking family in China by arranged marriage.\n\nUnfortunately, his father (my grandfather) was mentally disabled, and therefore unable to manage the family business. When my father was born, my grandfather was not able to name him, so the birth registrar remarked \"Well, he's the son of a Baba [a generic name used to refer to Peranakan males] so let's just call him Baba.\" So he became Tham Baba on his birth certificate, a name he is proud of and used all his life.\n\nThe Japanese invaded Malaya in World War II, and used the family home as their local military headquarters. My father overnight was kicked out of his home and became a starving child on the streets.\n\nAfter the war, my father studied at King George V school (where I also studied). In those days, all the teachers were British and educated in Eton and Cambridge. His teachers were sufficiently impressed with him, and the headmaster offered him a scholarship to study in the UK. He declined, as he felt he had to be the breadwinner in his family to support his mother and his sister.\n\nHe became an English teacher, and met my mother who was a Chinese language teacher. Despite not knowing much Chinese, he studied Mandarin in order to woo my mother.\n\nAgainst his family's wishes, he eloped to marry my mother, who came from a relatively poor family who ran a provision shop in the tiny village of Mambau, south of Seremban. He gave up on his stake of the family inheritance (which wasn't a lot anyway because most of it disappeared during the war and the rest was lost gambling by various relatives).\n\nDespite him being somewhat estranged from his mother, he continued to support his mother and his sister for most of his working life.\n\nHe moved with my mother to Malacca (where his grandfather originated from) and for a few years they were a happy, young and carefree couple, eating out and dancing at night.\n\nHe studied via correspondence and graduated from RMIT in Victoria as a land surveyor. He joined the civil service in the Survey Department. For many years, he traveled all over the country with my mother as a surveyor. I was born in Port Klang and my brother was born in Penang.\n\nHe gradually rose within the ranks of the civil service and eventually became Head of the Survey Department in Johor. One of the proudest moments in his career was hosting a visit from the Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohammed who he admired.\n\nHe retired early when he turned 50. In those days, many civil servants were British expats, and it was common that they receive a first class ticket \"back to the old country\" when they retired. Although my father was not British, he was given the same benefit. He traded the ticket for a vacation with my mother. They spent a month touring Europe.\n\nHe established a moderately successful private surveying practice for a few years. But he gave it all up to study various aspects of spirituality. Although he was an atheist in his early life, I picked up a book on the Buddha in my early teens and became a Buddhist, and I successfully converted him to Buddhism. He became an intensely spiritual man, and studied many spiritual and religious texts.\n\nHe has always had the gift of foresight, and he has been aware of his mortality. Even when I was a child, he would tell me \"Someday I will die of a heart attack, but don't worry because you will be an independent adult long before then.\"\n\nThe last time we saw him was in February 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic. He insisted that we say formal farewells and goodbyes to each other because he said \"this may well be the last time we will meet as a family.\" (which became true in hindsight).\n\nHe asked me to buy a Garmin smartwatch for him, which I gladfully did. He later confided to me he didn't really need the watch, but he wanted me to feel I had gifted him something significant before he died. How wise of him, as always.\n\nMy mother says in the last 6 months, he had been unusually loving, caring and considerate. Almost as if he wanted the cherish the last few months of their long lives together.\n\nHe walked a lot before the COVID lockdown. At one stage we both owned Fitbits, and I was his Fitbit buddy, so I knew he was doing easily 10,000 steps a day. During the lockdown, my mum said he would sometimes go on a drive in his WRX (he always had a love for sports cars).\n\nHe died after suffering a series of strokes. Last Wed, my mum noticed he was disoriented and had trouble keeping balance. On Thu, he had two big falls in front of the house near the front gate and hit his head. After that, he was unable to get up. My mum could not lift him. The neighbours rushed in to help, and offered to take him to the hospital. He declined. He fell again later in the evening and became half paralysed and his speech started slurring.\n\nHe realised he was going to die. On Friday, he consented to being admitted to hospital. Despite his paralysis and weakened condition, he shaved himself, put on his best clothes, and sat down outside to wait for the ambulance.\n\nHis doctor said his situation was critical, and offered a number of options, including invasive surgery. He refused, and said he only wished to live his remaining days as painlessly as possible.\n\nHe died several hours later on Saturday, but he was lucid and did not appear to be under much pain.\n\nThankfully, the COVID lockdown roadblocks has just been lifted in Malaysia, and my brother was able to drive and pick up his body and take care of mum.\n\nMy brother said his last journey to the crematorium was very serendipitous and symbolic, as the route took him past all the significant places in his life. It went past his school, our former house in Bukit Rasah, his old family mansion (which has been demolished to make way for a highway exit), and my mother's family provision shop and home in Mambau (now a hairdressing shop).\n\nHis ashes has been spread in the Straits of Malacca at the beaches of Port Dickson, where our family has spent many happy days together.","src/content/bio/my-father.md","2bca2f209557f8e4",{"html":211,"metadata":212},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/about/father.jpg\" alt=\"My father\">\nMy father was born on 17 June 1931, in Malaya under British rule.

My cousin tells me she was famous for her \"cat eyes\" makeup long before Ariana Grande. As a child, I loved trying on her clothes and makeup, but I quickly outgrew them as I was taller than her (same height as my Dad, but shorter than my brother).\n\nShe grew up living above a provision shop (convenience store) in the tiny village of Mambau just south of Seremban. Although not rich, she had a comfortable and happy childhood. During World War II, her family had a secret farm up in the hills so she was relatively well fed compared to my father who suffered terribly from malnourishment. The Japanese soldiers liked my mum and used to give her sweets. Despite that, she was glad when the war was over and she celebrated on the streets when British soldiers marched through and reclaimed the town.\n\nShe was well educated and was a Chinese language teacher before she married and continued until we kids were born and she became a full time housewife. She was extremely well versed in Chinese literature and was a voracious reader throughout her whole life. She was always up to date on world affairs, and taught me to look at the world from a wide perspective, which became useful in my career and life. She really taught me to see things as they are, and not as they are often hyped or perceived.\n\nUnfortunately neither me nor my brother were able to learn Chinese from her. She tried teaching us, but we weren't interested as we spoke English to my Dad and Malay to our friends (we were living in a tiny Malay village during my early years). My mum says I speak broken Cantonese like a three year old (when I stopped speaking the language and switched to English which I learnt from my neighbour).\n\nMy mum definitely had the \"kavorka\" and charmed everyone she met. As a kid, I was amazed as shopkeeper after shopkeeper literally fawned over her. Every time she bought something, she would always get \"extra\" - a larger serving, an extra prawn or piece of meat, a slightly longer piece of cloth, etc. My mum taught me to be gracious and nice to everyone I meet no matter what their position in life might be.\n\nMy mum also had a sharp wit and a great sense of humour, which she retained until the end of her life. Nothing escapes her attention, and she always saw the funny and positive side of things. She was also an extremely good judge of character, and saw through people. She always understood that everyone had both positive and negative aspects, and embraced the holistic.\n\nOf course she was a great cook, her dishes would always be the best food in the world for me. She does not cook complex dishes (my father was the showman chef), but her food was always tasty and perfectly balanced. My love of tofu comes from her (as it was her favourite). She did the world's best spam fritters fried with egg batter. My cousin said she did the best french toast ever. I also remember her lou shi fan, and steamed eggs with pork mince.\n\nWhen I was in school, she used to get up at 6am in the morning, and cooked a full breakfast for me and my brother before waking us up, so we were extremely well fed (no wonder I was plump all throughout high school). It wasn't until I was living away from home at uni that I really missed her cooking and started to find ways to replicate the taste (I never really succeeded despite my best efforts).\n\nI love my mum's stories of me as a child. She had a difficult childbirth with me, after a series of miscarriages. Apparently during birth I decided to go to sleep after crawling halfway down the birth canal, so she was in immense pain. Just as the doctors were deciding what to do (a caesarian would have been extremely risky) I woke up and came out as a strapping 8 pounder. As a toddler, I would often wander on my own and get lost all the time and once I was nearly run over by a truck crossing the road. I must have given her so much concern and worry.\n\nShe went on a European trip with my father in the 1980s, and her favourite city is Florence, but she also loved Austria and Switzerland. She says my Cantonese pronunciation is so bad I often mispronounce \"Australia\" as \"Austria\". Her favourite fruit is strawberries.\n\nShe nearly died 5 years ago from a perforated stomach ulcer, and the doctors did not think she would live but she pulled through even though she was so thin she was only 37 kg in weight. After my father died in September, I think she lost the will to live and her health deteriorated, although she had good and bad days. Often she would seem to stare away into the distance, or just close her eyes. She complained of a chill and searing pain on her left leg, and was admitted to hospital a few days ago, and died peacefully late last night/early this morning.\n\nShe was cremated and her ashes was be scattered at Port Dickson where she joined my father and I hope their souls have been reunited in some way.\n\nI had realised for some time now that the time we have to spend together as a family were numbered and increasingly more precious, so I am glad we have managed to visit my parents and my brother and his partner twice a year for the last few years, so we have all those memories to treasure. The last time I saw my parents alive were in February 2020 just before Covid so I am glad we were able to make that trip.","src/content/bio/my-mother.md","2f8a2d3d8e00e7b9",{"html":261,"metadata":262},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/about/mother.jpg\" alt=\"My mother\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She is the most beautiful woman I have ever known.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The 3rd daughter of a family of eight siblings, she has a bubbly, vivacious personality as well as strikingly beautiful looks, so she was guaranteed to be the centre of attention in any gathering.

She always understood that everyone had both positive and negative aspects, and embraced the holistic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Of course she was a great cook, her dishes would always be the best food in the world for me. She does not cook complex dishes (my father was the showman chef), but her food was always tasty and perfectly balanced. My love of tofu comes from her (as it was her favourite). She did the world’s best spam fritters fried with egg batter. My cousin said she did the best french toast ever. I also remember her lou shi fan, and steamed eggs with pork mince.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When I was in school, she used to get up at 6am in the morning, and cooked a full breakfast for me and my brother before waking us up, so we were extremely well fed (no wonder I was plump all throughout high school). It wasn’t until I was living away from home at uni that I really missed her cooking and started to find ways to replicate the taste (I never really succeeded despite my best efforts).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I love my mum’s stories of me as a child. She had a difficult childbirth with me, after a series of miscarriages. Apparently during birth I decided to go to sleep after crawling halfway down the birth canal, so she was in immense pain. Just as the doctors were deciding what to do (a caesarian would have been extremely risky) I woke up and came out as a strapping 8 pounder. As a toddler, I would often wander on my own and get lost all the time and once I was nearly run over by a truck crossing the road. I must have given her so much concern and worry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She went on a European trip with my father in the 1980s, and her favourite city is Florence, but she also loved Austria and Switzerland. She says my Cantonese pronunciation is so bad I often mispronounce “Australia” as “Austria”. Her favourite fruit is strawberries.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She nearly died 5 years ago from a perforated stomach ulcer, and the doctors did not think she would live but she pulled through even though she was so thin she was only 37 kg in weight. After my father died in September, I think she lost the will to live and her health deteriorated, although she had good and bad days. Often she would seem to stare away into the distance, or just close her eyes. She complained of a chill and searing pain on her left leg, and was admitted to hospital a few days ago, and died peacefully late last night/early this morning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She was cremated and her ashes was be scattered at Port Dickson where she joined my father and I hope their souls have been reunited in some way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I had realised for some time now that the time we have to spend together as a family were numbered and increasingly more precious, so I am glad we have managed to visit my parents and my brother and his partner twice a year for the last few years, so we have all those memories to treasure. The last time I saw my parents alive were in February 2020 just before Covid so I am glad we were able to make that trip.\u003C/p>",{"headings":263,"imagePaths":264,"frontmatter":265},[],[],{"section":137,"title":254,"description":255,"weight":253,"gallery":256,"minutesRead":216,"extra":266},[],"retirement",{"id":267,"data":269,"body":273,"filePath":274,"digest":275,"rendered":276},{"section":80,"weight":270,"title":271,"description":272},400,"Retirement (2020-)","Life beyond working","I've always wanted to retire early.

I was looking\nforward to it, and boasted to all my friends, and they were probably sick\nand tired of hearing it.\n\nLittle did I realise how much of sacrifice my parents had to make to enable\nthis. My father was a civil servant, and he had opted for early retirement.\nHe took on jobs with a private surveying firm to fund my education.\n\nI worked during school holidays as a draghtsperson for the firm, and I used\nto wonder why I was never paid. Later on I found out my wages were also\nused to fund my education.\n\nMy father bought me a plane ticket, and he calculated enough money for me to\nlast for my entire stay in Australia, and gave me all of it and said \"Don't\nspend it all, because there is no more, so you'll have to return home if you\nrun out.\"\n\n## High School in Australia\n\nI went to Sydney and studied at Randwick. I shared a flat with fellow students\nand made many new friends.\n\nAt the end of the year, I sat for the Higher School Certificate and managed to\nget a score of 488, the highest in my school and enough to enable me to apply\nfor any course I cared to study, including medicine.\n\nMy father tried to persuade me to take up medicine, but I was squeamish and\nit didn't appeal to me. I wanted to study architecture, but for some reason\nmy father wasn't keen and he said the job prospects were not high in Malaysia.\n\nHe persuaded me to study engineering, which I wasn't too keen on but it\naligned with my problem solving skills. To hedge my bets, I applied for a double\ndegree in B.Sc. and B.Eng at the University of Sydney (USyd) and I was accepted.\n\n## University of Sydney, Year 1\n\nI chose USyd over the University of New South Wales (UNSW) even though\nthe engineering degree at UNSW was supposedly superior. I was a romantic.\nI had recently watched the film \"Chariots of Fire\" and I wanted a university\nwith a Great Hall, gargoyles, and all the pomp and circumstances normally\nassociated with great British universities. I\nwanted a debating society, a rowing club, a dramatic club (even though I\ndidn't plan on joining any of these). I imagined myself following in the\nfootsteps of Clive James (I had recently read his autobiography) or Jill Kerr\nConway. I thought I might become a bohemian.\n\nThe motto for the University of Sydney is \"Sidere mens eadem mutato\" (loosely\ntranslated as \"though the stars may be different, some things remain the same\",\nimplying that the university was the Antipodean equivalent of Oxford and\nCambridge).\n\nIndeed, in my first year, it seemed the university and students were intent\non copying traditions from halfway across the world. The Chancellor gave a\nstirring speech in the Great Hall, a race was organised around the quadrangle\n(evoking the famous scene from Chariots of Fire), and there were enough\nstuffy looking professors speaking in Received Pronunciation.\n\nFor the science subjects, USyd ran two streams of courses, the standard stream\nsuitable for most students, and a separate set of \"advanced\" or \"honours\"\nclasses intended for students who wished to challenge themselves and wanted\nto learn more.\n\nI was persuaded to enrol in the advanced or \"honours\" science classes because\nof my relatively high HSC result. Later on I found that this was probably\nthe smartest decision I ever made. I found through a friend that\nthey will never fail a student taking the advanced classes no matter how badly\nthey did. The thinking was if a student was brave enough to enrol in an\nadvanced class in the first place, then they should be rewarded with a pass\neven though they didn't achieve their objectives.\n\nI was also pleased to discover I was awarded the E. Trenchard Miller Scholarship\neven though I didn't apply for it. Apparently it is awarded to the top 5\nstudents enrolling in a B.Sc. It wasn't a lot of money, but enough to cover\nbuying textbooks. Apparently I was the \"unknown 5th\" - the other four were\nprivate school students who all knew each other (they all ended up becoming\nmy friends as well because we saw each other in classes often).\n\nI remember enrolling for Computer Science, and John Mackin and Ray Loygaza\nwere processing the students. When they saw me, they teased me because I did\nnot look like a typical computer science student (or, at least, their notion\nof what a typical computer science student looked like). They asked me was I\nsure I was enrolling in the right class, \"... because the Arts Faculty is\njust down the corridor...\" (it wasn't).\n\nI really enjoyed my first year at university. It was everything I expected it\nto be. I made many friends, some that I still keep in contact with today.\n\nI managed to get completely drunk for the very first time in my life. Ironically,\nit was at a Maths Society party. I was served wine, which I had never tasted\nbefore (although I prided myself on my ability to drink beer). I liked it,\nobviously drank too much, and on my way back home I mysteriously lost the\nability to walk. So I had to lean against a wall, and crawled all the way\nhome (luckily, at the time I lived at Darlington St, only a few minutes away).\n\nThere weren't many Asians or females enrolled in engineering. I remember\nprobably seeing maybe less than 20-30 Asian students in the advanced classes,\nand perhaps a dozen females in the engineering classes.\n\nSome of the professors were quite funny or eccentric. I remember a computer\nscience professor who only wore shades of purple, and he was quickly\nnicknamed \"Mr. Purple.\"\n\nA maths lecturer once declared during a lecture whilst doing a proof:\n\"Now it's immediately obvious that ...\"\n\nHe suddenly stopped mid sentence, and paused deep in thought. Everyone could\nsee that he was gnawed with sudden uncertainty. He started muttering, and\ngradually his uncertainly became anxiety and fear. He excused himself, rushed\nout of the lecture, and came back a few minutes later beaming and smiling.\nHe proudly announced \"It's all good, everthing is clear now. It IS\nimmediately obvious that ...\"\n\nThe whole class roared with laughter. It wasn't until much later I was told\nhe does that routine every year to all the new students.\n\n## Year 2\n\nBy Year 2, everything had settled into a routine. I pretty knew who my friends\nwere, and which subjects I liked or disliked.\n\nLittle by little, my grades started to slip. Not because I was studying less.\nIf anything, I probably studied more than ever.\n\nBut I was starting to realise perhaps I am not as smart as I thought I was.\nI had done very well so far relying on my memory and problem solving skills. I\nam now discovering I don't grasp complex abstract and theoretical concepts as\nwell as others in my class.\n\nI was starting to struggle with completing maths and physics assignments\nbecause I often don't really understand the problems anymore.\n\nThe only classes that I still managed to do well in were the computer science\nclasses. I remember getting more than 100% in one assignment because I argued\nwith the lecturer that my solution was superior (my compiler generated no code\nbecause it correctly determined the example program fed into it contained\nonly redundant and unused code). The lecturer agreed with me and marked my\nassignment 110%. It was my finest nerd moment.\n\nI remember crying after the Physics paper in the final term exams. I had done\nvery badly. I had completed barely one third of the questions, and even those\nI weren't sure I made the right answers. I was most likely going to receive my\nfirst fail grade.\n\nImagine my surprise when the results were published. Not only did I pass, I\nreceived a High Distinction in Physics. I remember talking to my tutor about it,\nand he chuckled and said \"Yes, you did not do well in the final paper, but since\nyou had done so well up until then we thought it was a case of nerves, and gave\nyou a High Distinction anyway. We hope you will return next year to major in\nPhysics.\"\n\nHe was sad when I told him I couldn't possibly major in Physics because I\nwasn't having a case of nerves, I was genuinely starting to struggle and I\ndon't feel I have the ability to continue.\n\n## Year 3\n\nYears 1 and 2 were very hectic years because by enrolling in two degrees\n(B.Sc. and B.Eng) I had to attend two sets of classes. I had a very\nbusy timetable and barely had time for extra curricular activities.\n\nIn contrast, third year was a dedicated B.Sc. year where we complete our\nmajors and return to finish the B.Eng requirements in Years 4 and 5. I decided\nto major in Pure Mathematics and Computer Science.\n\nI suddenly had free time on my hands. I was starting to enjoy life, eating out,\nwatching movies, going to parties. I am finally becoming the bohemian that\nI've always wanted to be.\n\nTo my shock and horror, I discovered the pile of money that my father gave me,\nwhich was supposed to last me for all my university years, was running out.\nAt this rate, I don't have enough money to last the rest of the year, let alone\nfuture years. I was facing financial ruin, and literally becoming a poor\nstarving student.\n\nI started cutting down on meals and lost a lot of weight. I stopped buying\nrecords, or watching movies. It was not enough. I couldn't face the prospect\nof asking my father for more money as he had been very clear that there was\nnone left. I began to think I need to get a part time job.\n\nI saw an ad on the university noticeboards looking for a casual programmer. I\napplied. To my surprise, they asked me to come in for an interview. It was\nthe research and development subsidiary of a building services company.\n\nWhen I arrived, the manager took one look at me and said \"When can you start?\"\nI said I could start anytime, and I could work maybe 2 days a week. He said\n\"Great, we'll see you next week.\"\n\nThe work turned out to be interesting. They were building products such as\nlift controllers and access card readers. They used 8086 chips embedded in\ntheir circuit designs (running a proprietary real time operating system) and\nused a PC as a cross compiler. I helped them test the code was running\ncorrectly and enhanced the code if it didn't work. I remember struggling with\nthe MIL key reader that was commonly used for access control. It was very\nfiddly. I was paid $10 an hour (it was below the minimum wage, but it didn't\nmatter because I had no qualifications).\n\nA few months later, a friend of mine got a job as foreign exchange trader\nfor a securities firm (Bain & Co.). They had just bought an HP 9000 minicomputer\nrunning Unix and they wanted someone to work as a part time system\nadministrator. He asked me if I was interested. Of course I was, I relished\nthe prospect of having a whole minicomputer to play with.\n\nI went and met his boss, who also asked me when I could start. They also paid\nbetter - $15 an hour (around minimum wage).\n\nVery soon, my money problems were solved.\n\nI have the dubious honour of introducing Bain & Co to the Internet. At that\ntime, there was no pervasive TCP/IP network in Australia. Sites in the US\nconnected to each other via dedicated lines and dial up modems using the UUCP\nprotocol.\n\nIn Australia, the academic insitutions created an alternative network called\nACSnet (Australian Computer Society networtk), and the software for ACSnet\nhappened to be written by Bob Kummerfeld and Piers Dick Lauder at the University\nof Sydney. ACSnet connected to the ARPAnet and UUCP backbone in the US and\nother countries to form a mega network that people called \"the Internet.\"\n\nThe cost of getting onto ACSnet was borne by participating institutions. The\nlicence fee for the software was A$3,000 and in addition one had to pay for\neither a dedicated line or dialup modem.\n\nI convinced Bain & Co in my role as system administrator that there would\nbe benefits of joining ACSnet. I talked about email, and the possibility of\ndownloading open source software. The mentioned of free software convinced\nmy boss.\n\nSo Bain & Co became one of the first non-academic organisation in Australia\nto become part of the Internet (bain.oz.au was our domain name) and I was\nlisted in WHOIS as the administrator. In those days, the number of nodes in\nAustralia were few and a full network map could be drawn on an A4 sheet.\n\n## Year 4\n\nI was supposed to go back to the Faculty of Engineering to complete the 3rd\nand 4th years of B.Eng but I really wasn't that keen on engineering, so I\ndecided to do an honours year in Computer Science instead. I did a few hons\ncourses in my 3rd year and enjoyed them.\n\nAll honours students were expected to complete a thesis as well as do\ncoursework. Students were allocated a supervisor and generally did some\nresearch aligned to the supervisor's research topics. I wasn't very interested\nin any of the topics on offer, which was mostly in artificial intelligence\nand cryptography/security (two topics that are still very popular today).\n\nI wasn't really thinking of a career in academia or in computing. To me,\ncomputing was a hobby and I had no idea what I would do for a living (in my\nmind, I was still a hopelessly romantic bohemian who would likely live in\npoverty for most of my life).\n\nI was very interested in music and I suggested I could do a thesis in\ncomputer music. Out of all the computer science courses I did, the ones I\nreally loved were in computer languages and compiler construction. I had an\nidea of writing a computer language for representing music, that created\ncode that performed music via the MIDI interface to synthesizers.\n\nThe Computer Science department was very much against my idea from the outset.\nI was told it wasn't\nvery career oriented or practical, and there would be no supervisor who could\ngive me guidance as none of the staff were musically inclined. I was adamant\nand said I wasn't interested in any of the topics on offer and if I couldn't\npursue my idea then I would give up on the course and study Engineering.\n\nIn the end, the department came up with a solution that everyone was happy with,\nincluding me. Instead of having a single supervisor, I would have 4. My\nformal supervisor would be Prof. Allan Bromley, who was the assistant head of\nthe department. He would guide me with all the formalities of completing my\nthesis and offer general advice and monitor my progress. Another professor\nwho was doing research on computer automated Chinese language translation\nwould help grade my thesis. A PhD student, Bruce Ellis, who was also a musician,\nwould assist me with my research and offer practical guidance. Finally,\nthe head of computer music in the Music Department would also offer me guidance in\nmatters relating to music and allowed me access to the computer music studio.\n\nI was estatic. I was especially happy to work with Bruce, who I admired\ngreatly as his coding skills were legendary. He once wrote a C compiler in a\nsingle night, twice. He almost completed it the first time, but an electrical\nstorm interrupted power and he lost everything. Calmly, he took a swig of\nWild Turkey and did it all over again. He had also returned from a stint\ninterning at the famous AT&T Bell Labs in New Jersey along with all the Unix\nluminaries. He showed me all the keyboards and synthesizers he bought in the US.\n\nI was also working a lot at Bain & Co. In addition to doing system\nadministration, I was starting to do some coding and became very interested\nin the mathematics of the financial industry: bond and option pricing,\nportfolio management and rebalancing.\n\nAt one stage, I was working nearly 30-40 hours per week and hardly showed up\nat university. The university became really concerned about my lack of\nacademic progress. I remember Dr. Bromley once gave me a stern warning and\nsaid I really needed to cut down on my part time job, and start focusing\non completing my thesis. When I explained I needed the money, the university\noffered a solution: I could start tutoring first year students and get paid.\nI was pretty happy with that.\n\nI got along really well with the other honours students. We were a small\ngroup with only about 30-40 people and we were allocated a common room in\nthe basement. Some of us virtually lived there on mattresses, I was lucky to\nbe living close by, sharing a townhouse with a flatmate who had recently\ngraduated and working for DEC.\n\nAt one stage the university suspected me of hacking their computer. I am not\nsure why, but I think they found logs of me logging out just before someone\nelse logged in on a hacked account, and then me logging back in almost\nimmediately after. So they reasoned I must have been the hacker, and testing\nthe hacked account. Apparently the evidence, although circumstantial, was\nso incriminating even some of my friends believed I must be the hacker.\n\nI was asked to attend a hearing with the university's security officer. The\nevidence was presented before me and I was invited to comment. I said I don't\nhave the credentials of the hacked account, but I did remember someone\nsaying they were in a hurry to print something, and could I log out from\nthe terminal for a few minutes to allow them to start a print job, and I\nlogged back in immediately afterwards.\n\nIn the end, they dismissed the charges as the evidence was inconclusive.\nMy friends were really worried I would be expelled from university, but I\nwasn't because I knew I was innocent.\n\nSoon, the deadline for the thesis was approaching. I remember my formal\nsupervisor Dr. Bromley was really worried because I had made virtually no\nprogress apart from a literature survey and a preliminary grammar specification\nfor the music language. I promised him I would give up all work and start\nfocusing exclusively on completing the thesis.\n\nI ended up barely eating or sleeping for the next fortnight, and worked\nalmost constantly on writing code. I found bugs in the C compiler and had to\nimplement workarounds in assembler code.\n\nI finally managed to get it actually working, and held a demonstration where\nI wrote out a song in my music language, have it compiled through my system\nand then performed on a rig of keyboards I had set up in the basement.\n\nAfter that, I think the department was much happier, but Dr. Bromley reminded\nme it's one thing to have a working system, I still needed to write my thesis.\nSo I spent another two sleepless weeks writing hundreds of pages. I was using\nthe `troff` package to typset my thesis, and I used the `mm` macro package.\nI found bugs in the `mm` code and ended up making a local copy and modifying\nit.\n\nI managed to submit an almost completed thesis on the day the first draft was\ndue. I was given the impression the first draft was meant to be 80% complete.\nIt was only later on that I discovered out it was only a checkpoint to\nfind out how students\nwere progressing. Some people only submitted a few chapters. The department\nwas very impressed with my effort, it seemed I had completed almost a year's\nwork in the last few weeks and all was forgiven. I then had the luxury of\nrelaxing for the next few weeks whilst others were frantically trying to\ncomplete their work.\n\nIf you want to read more about my honours year adventures, I have a website\ndedicated to that: [Hons87](https://hons87.github.io).\n\n## Graduation\n\nWhen the results were announced, I was very pleased to discover not only have\nI completed the requirements for my B.Sc. (Hons) degree, but I had been\nawarded the University Medal, along with another classmate, Mark James.\n\nI was even more surprised that most of the original 5 recipients of the E\nTrenchard Miller Memorial Scholarships had also won medals in their respective\nmajors - Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. I was very happy for my friends.\n\nI found later on that the award of the university medal to me was highly\ncontroversial. The professor who was doing research on Chinese language\ntranslation did not understand my paper at all and wanted to fail me. I was\ntold Bruce Ellis made a spirited defence on my behalf and argued that what\nI had done was highly significant. I believe my software was used to teach\nmusic students in computer music for several years afterwards.\n\nMy parents and my brother flew over to attend my graduation and we had a\nwonderful family reunion and they enjoyed visiting Australia.","src/content/bio/university.md","d3776733aec9e7cc",{"html":318,"metadata":319},"\u003Cp>I was pretty happy when my parents said they were planning to send me to\nAustralia to finish my high school and study in a university. I was looking\nforward to it, and boasted to all my friends, and they were probably sick\nand tired of hearing it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Little did I realise how much of sacrifice my parents had to make to enable\nthis. My father was a civil servant, and he had opted for early retirement.\nHe took on jobs with a private surveying firm to fund my education.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I worked during school holidays as a draghtsperson for the firm, and I used\nto wonder why I was never paid. Later on I found out my wages were also\nused to fund my education.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My father bought me a plane ticket, and he calculated enough money for me to\nlast for my entire stay in Australia, and gave me all of it and said “Don’t\nspend it all, because there is no more, so you’ll have to return home if you\nrun out.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"high-school-in-australia\">High School in Australia\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I went to Sydney and studied at Randwick. I shared a flat with fellow students\nand made many new friends.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At the end of the year, I sat for the Higher School Certificate and managed to\nget a score of 488, the highest in my school and enough to enable me to apply\nfor any course I cared to study, including medicine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My father tried to persuade me to take up medicine, but I was squeamish and\nit didn’t appeal to me. I wanted to study architecture, but for some reason\nmy father wasn’t keen and he said the job prospects were not high in Malaysia.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He persuaded me to study engineering, which I wasn’t too keen on but it\naligned with my problem solving skills. To hedge my bets, I applied for a double\ndegree in B.Sc. and B.Eng at the University of Sydney (USyd) and I was accepted.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"university-of-sydney-year-1\">University of Sydney, Year 1\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I chose USyd over the University of New South Wales (UNSW) even though\nthe engineering degree at UNSW was supposedly superior. I was a romantic.\nI had recently watched the film “Chariots of Fire” and I wanted a university\nwith a Great Hall, gargoyles, and all the pomp and circumstances normally\nassociated with great British universities. I\nwanted a debating society, a rowing club, a dramatic club (even though I\ndidn’t plan on joining any of these). I imagined myself following in the\nfootsteps of Clive James (I had recently read his autobiography) or Jill Kerr\nConway. I thought I might become a bohemian.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The motto for the University of Sydney is “Sidere mens eadem mutato” (loosely\ntranslated as “though the stars may be different, some things remain the same”,\nimplying that the university was the Antipodean equivalent of Oxford and\nCambridge).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Indeed, in my first year, it seemed the university and students were intent\non copying traditions from halfway across the world. The Chancellor gave a\nstirring speech in the Great Hall, a race was organised around the quadrangle\n(evoking the famous scene from Chariots of Fire), and there were enough\nstuffy looking professors speaking in Received Pronunciation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For the science subjects, USyd ran two streams of courses, the standard stream\nsuitable for most students, and a separate set of “advanced” or “honours”\nclasses intended for students who wished to challenge themselves and wanted\nto learn more.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was persuaded to enrol in the advanced or “honours” science classes because\nof my relatively high HSC result. Later on I found that this was probably\nthe smartest decision I ever made. I found through a friend that\nthey will never fail a student taking the advanced classes no matter how badly\nthey did. The thinking was if a student was brave enough to enrol in an\nadvanced class in the first place, then they should be rewarded with a pass\neven though they didn’t achieve their objectives.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was also pleased to discover I was awarded the E. Trenchard Miller Scholarship\neven though I didn’t apply for it. Apparently it is awarded to the top 5\nstudents enrolling in a B.Sc. It wasn’t a lot of money, but enough to cover\nbuying textbooks. Apparently I was the “unknown 5th” - the other four were\nprivate school students who all knew each other (they all ended up becoming\nmy friends as well because we saw each other in classes often).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I remember enrolling for Computer Science, and John Mackin and Ray Loygaza\nwere processing the students. When they saw me, they teased me because I did\nnot look like a typical computer science student (or, at least, their notion\nof what a typical computer science student looked like). They asked me was I\nsure I was enrolling in the right class, ”… because the Arts Faculty is\njust down the corridor…” (it wasn’t).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I really enjoyed my first year at university. It was everything I expected it\nto be. I made many friends, some that I still keep in contact with today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I managed to get completely drunk for the very first time in my life. Ironically,\nit was at a Maths Society party. I was served wine, which I had never tasted\nbefore (although I prided myself on my ability to drink beer). I liked it,\nobviously drank too much, and on my way back home I mysteriously lost the\nability to walk. So I had to lean against a wall, and crawled all the way\nhome (luckily, at the time I lived at Darlington St, only a few minutes away).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There weren’t many Asians or females enrolled in engineering. I remember\nprobably seeing maybe less than 20-30 Asian students in the advanced classes,\nand perhaps a dozen females in the engineering classes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some of the professors were quite funny or eccentric. I remember a computer\nscience professor who only wore shades of purple, and he was quickly\nnicknamed “Mr. Purple.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A maths lecturer once declared during a lecture whilst doing a proof:\n“Now it’s immediately obvious that …”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He suddenly stopped mid sentence, and paused deep in thought. Everyone could\nsee that he was gnawed with sudden uncertainty. He started muttering, and\ngradually his uncertainly became anxiety and fear. He excused himself, rushed\nout of the lecture, and came back a few minutes later beaming and smiling.\nHe proudly announced “It’s all good, everthing is clear now. It IS\nimmediately obvious that …”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The whole class roared with laughter. It wasn’t until much later I was told\nhe does that routine every year to all the new students.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"year-2\">Year 2\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>By Year 2, everything had settled into a routine. I pretty knew who my friends\nwere, and which subjects I liked or disliked.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Little by little, my grades started to slip. Not because I was studying less.\nIf anything, I probably studied more than ever.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But I was starting to realise perhaps I am not as smart as I thought I was.\nI had done very well so far relying on my memory and problem solving skills. I\nam now discovering I don’t grasp complex abstract and theoretical concepts as\nwell as others in my class.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was starting to struggle with completing maths and physics assignments\nbecause I often don’t really understand the problems anymore.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The only classes that I still managed to do well in were the computer science\nclasses. I remember getting more than 100% in one assignment because I argued\nwith the lecturer that my solution was superior (my compiler generated no code\nbecause it correctly determined the example program fed into it contained\nonly redundant and unused code). The lecturer agreed with me and marked my\nassignment 110%. It was my finest nerd moment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I remember crying after the Physics paper in the final term exams. I had done\nvery badly. I had completed barely one third of the questions, and even those\nI weren’t sure I made the right answers. I was most likely going to receive my\nfirst fail grade.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Imagine my surprise when the results were published. Not only did I pass, I\nreceived a High Distinction in Physics. I remember talking to my tutor about it,\nand he chuckled and said “Yes, you did not do well in the final paper, but since\nyou had done so well up until then we thought it was a case of nerves, and gave\nyou a High Distinction anyway. We hope you will return next year to major in\nPhysics.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He was sad when I told him I couldn’t possibly major in Physics because I\nwasn’t having a case of nerves, I was genuinely starting to struggle and I\ndon’t feel I have the ability to continue.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"year-3\">Year 3\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Years 1 and 2 were very hectic years because by enrolling in two degrees\n(B.Sc. and B.Eng) I had to attend two sets of classes.

The\nevidence was presented before me and I was invited to comment. I said I don’t\nhave the credentials of the hacked account, but I did remember someone\nsaying they were in a hurry to print something, and could I log out from\nthe terminal for a few minutes to allow them to start a print job, and I\nlogged back in immediately afterwards.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the end, they dismissed the charges as the evidence was inconclusive.\nMy friends were really worried I would be expelled from university, but I\nwasn’t because I knew I was innocent.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Soon, the deadline for the thesis was approaching. I remember my formal\nsupervisor Dr. Bromley was really worried because I had made virtually no\nprogress apart from a literature survey and a preliminary grammar specification\nfor the music language. I promised him I would give up all work and start\nfocusing exclusively on completing the thesis.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I ended up barely eating or sleeping for the next fortnight, and worked\nalmost constantly on writing code. I found bugs in the C compiler and had to\nimplement workarounds in assembler code.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I finally managed to get it actually working, and held a demonstration where\nI wrote out a song in my music language, have it compiled through my system\nand then performed on a rig of keyboards I had set up in the basement.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After that, I think the department was much happier, but Dr. Bromley reminded\nme it’s one thing to have a working system, I still needed to write my thesis.\nSo I spent another two sleepless weeks writing hundreds of pages. I was using\nthe \u003Ccode>troff\u003C/code> package to typset my thesis, and I used the \u003Ccode>mm\u003C/code> macro package.\nI found bugs in the \u003Ccode>mm\u003C/code> code and ended up making a local copy and modifying\nit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I managed to submit an almost completed thesis on the day the first draft was\ndue. I was given the impression the first draft was meant to be 80% complete.\nIt was only later on that I discovered out it was only a checkpoint to\nfind out how students\nwere progressing. Some people only submitted a few chapters. The department\nwas very impressed with my effort, it seemed I had completed almost a year’s\nwork in the last few weeks and all was forgiven. I then had the luxury of\nrelaxing for the next few weeks whilst others were frantically trying to\ncomplete their work.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you want to read more about my honours year adventures, I have a website\ndedicated to that: \u003Ca href=\"https://hons87.github.io\">Hons87\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"graduation\">Graduation\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>When the results were announced, I was very pleased to discover not only have\nI completed the requirements for my B.Sc. (Hons) degree, but I had been\nawarded the University Medal, along with another classmate, Mark James.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was even more surprised that most of the original 5 recipients of the E\nTrenchard Miller Memorial Scholarships had also won medals in their respective\nmajors - Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry.

The professor who was doing research on Chinese language\ntranslation did not understand my paper at all and wanted to fail me.

If you want to read my resume, you can visit\nmy profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christham/). It is a\nanecdotal retelling of highlights from my work life from a personal perspective.\n\n## Option Technology\n\nBain & Co. (now part of Deutsche Bank) did offer me a permanent job after I\ngraduated, but I was keen to explore other options. I was attracted to a\nfintech startup called Option Technology - they were a boutique options\ntrading firm that specialised in manufacturing synthetic options allowing\ntheir clients to hedge their foreign exchange exposure.\n\nThe phrase \"fintech startup\" did not exist back then but the company definitely\nfitted the label. It was founded by a charismatic person, Ralph McKay and his\nwife Nanette. The hiring process included a spiritual reading of my\nsoul by Ralph's guru. I decided I instantly liked the McKays.\n\nThe company had won a contract to productionise the software they used to\nfor trading and portfolio management of options, and I was hired as an analyst.\n\nThe work involved translating the mathematical concepts behind option pricing\nand so called \"Greek letter\" derived parameters used for risk measurement and\nmanagement. We used a series of Sun workstations to do the computations, and\nI used my knowledge of distributed computing to distribute the workload across\nthe workstations. I ended up writing a technical paper on it which was\npublished on SunTech Journal.\n\nMy work colleagues were all recent graduates from the University of Sydney.\nLike Bain & Co, they would only hire people from USyd and never from UNSW.\nThe old students university network operated very strongly back then. Some\ninstitutions even cared which private school you went to.\n\nIt was my first real job, and I loved it. I bought a compact camera, and used\nit to take photos when we travelled, which was seldom because I couldn't quite\nafford plane tickets. We had just bought an apartment, interest rates were\nsky high at 17%, and almost all our spare cash went towards paying the\nmortgage.\n\nAll the coding was done in C, a language I was familiar with. The company\nwanted to switch to C++. Object oriented computing was a fad in those days,\nand everyone wanted to jump on the bandwagon. The company sent us to C++\ntraining classes, taught by none other than Bjarne Strostrup, the inventor\nof the language.\n\nI hated C++, and had long conversations with Bjarne. He accepted my criticisms\nbut said C++ was a compromise given the need to transpile to C. He said C++\nwill improve once there were object code compilers. To this date, I dislike\nC++ and have never written a line of code in it. I also dislike all the C++\nrelated languages like Java and Objective C.\n\nUnfortunately, Option Technology ran into financial difficulty because the\nventure capital dried out, and they were not able to get a product to market\nin time. Sadly, I had to find another job.\n\n## State Bank Victoria\n\nI soon found a position as an analyst at the Treasury Department of State\nBank Victoria (SBV). Even though the bank was based in Melbourne, they had\npurchased Australian Bank (which was primarily a trading bank), and retained\nall the trading functions which were in Sydney.\n\nI continued my work on option pricing and risk management there. I was\nemployed by the Treasury Division, and not part of the IT department, so I\nhad a lot of freedom that I probably would not have if I worked in IT. For\nexample, I had root access to the production Pyramid Unix supercomputer,\nbecause they just trusted me. I definitely had full access to my Sun 3/60\nworkstation, and completely replaced the horrible Sun graphical user interface\nwith X Windows, which I compiled myself, and I downloaded lots of source code\nfrom USENet, including Perl, gcc, bash and the first version of Python.\n\nOne of my duties was to write a simple trading system in Oracle, as the bank\nhad purchased Oracle but it was a white elephant as all the production system\nused C-ISAM files. I wrote a very simple set of screens, and was made the\nOracle database administrator. I became super nerdy and managed to configure\nOracle to use raw partitions to store database tables, something brand new\nat the time.\n\nOnce, I completely botched up an Oracle upgrade, resulting in a loss of about\n3 days of transactions. I cried, and I was sure I will be fired. To my surprise,\nthey were okay about it. All the traders supported me by staying back to\nre-enter the transactions manually and I was glad I kept my job. I learnt a\nbig lesson that day.\n\nI co authored a technical paper on Unix security, which advocated for an\nimproved Unix password system as the current one (based on a slightly broken\n3DES implementation) is to easy to compromise using brute force password\nsearching. To prove the point, I wrote a password guesser that took advantage\nof large memory on modern Unix computers and as a test managed to hack into\nseveral accounts at one of the computers at the University of Sydney.\n\nSeveral days later, I received a call from the system administrator at the\nuniversity. They had \"discovered\" my hacking efforts. I explained the situation.\nI think they forgave me. Then they said in the future if I wanted to use\ntheir computer, I could get my own account for $10 a month. They offered\ndial up IP internet services!\n\nSo my home computer managed to be one of the first personal computers\nconnected to the Internet, well before the word was even known to the public.\nIt was fun. I ran NetBSD at home, and was able to sync to the official\nrepository, and effectively ran a rolling release distribution, keeping\nmy computer up to date with the latest version.\n\nEven though I was still relatively inexperienced, my position at SBV was\nreasonably highly paid compared to other staff at the Bank. I was graded a Level\n4 which was equivalent to a bank manager in status. I was very surprised when\nI visited the head office in Melbourne for a training course that I was allowed\nto dine in the executive room with full table service. I really thought I had\nmade it.\n\nState Bank Victoria went through a crisis in 1990. Irresponsible lending by\na subsidiary (Tricontinental) led to its collapse, and it had to be rescued\nby the Commonwealth Bank that bought it for just over $2 billion. I think I\neven took a photocopy of the bankers cheque for the sale amount.\n\nSoon I was working for the Commonwealth Bank in the large Treasury office\n(it seemed like the size of a football field) at Harrington St. I did not\nenjoy working here. Commonwealth Bank was owned by the Federal Government and\nit was like working in the public service - people had tenure and the whole\nplace was very bureaucratic. Due to union regulations, staff were forced to\ntake morning and afternoon breaks. I wanted to work through, but was politely\nescorted out where I was made to sit in the courtyard for 15 minutes.\n\nMy boss knew how unhappy I was and sent me to a \"training course\" that included\nboth bank staff and their key clients. It was supposedly about \"options\" which\nI thought I already knew. The course was a week long stay in house at the\nbank's exclusive executive training facility at St. Ives.\n\nI wasn't happy to attend. I was studying for a Graduate Diploma in\nInvestment Management at the Securities Insitute of Australia and I had an\nexam coming up right after the course. I needed valuable study time.\n\nI arrived by taxi at the training facility and immediately realised it was a\njunket offered as a incentive to corporate bank customers and regarded as a\nbit of a perk by staff. The \"training\" was minimal, it was all food and wine\nprovided in copious amounts. People were cuddling up to each other, it was\nlike a night in Hugh Hefner's mansion. I locked myself in my room and started\nstudying.\n\nWhen I came back, my boss winked at me and asked me if I had a \"great time.\" I\nwasn't sure how to respond, so I meekly smiled.\n\n## NCR/AT&T\n\nI was still unhappy at the Bank and decided to look for another job. I saw\na job ad looking for \"Unix System Engineers,\" Since I loved Unix, I thought\nthis was a great opportunity to do what I love for a living, just like the\nfun times I had at Bain & Co.\n\nI applied, and to my surprise was accepted, mainly because the interviewer\ngot along really well with me. I was graded a Level 5, which was quite a\nsenior grade, and some of the existing system engineers who were older than\nme were a bit envious.\n\nSoon after, AT&T bought NCR and I was actually excited. I am working for the\ncompany that invented Unix!\n\nI had a great time working at the company and in hindsight it was a great\nplace to work. I made lifelong friends, and the company was willing to pay\nfor my Masters of Applied Finance degree that I had enrolled in. For my\nvarious contributions, I was awarded Employee of the Month twice.\n\nThe company sent me on my first overseas business trip. I went to Copenhagen\nfor a week training, and it was a very unique experience. I experienced Europe\nfor the very first time, and I made friends with a colleague from Turkey and\ntogether she and I explored Copenhagen in our spare time and took lots of\nphotos. I also got along well with some Italian colleagues and we went out\nto visit Tivoli. On my last day, my Turkish colleague and I took a train to\nvisit Krönborg, also known as \"Hamlet's Castle\" as Shakespeare's play was\nsupposedly set there.\n\nAfter that I went to Los Angeles for two weeks training. I was with another\nAussie colleague from the Brisbane office. He had hired a car, and because\nI did not drive, he would take me everywhere. We had a great time trying out\ndifferent restaurants for dinner, and going shopping and visitng famous places\nthat I've only seen in films, like the Beverly Hills Center and Santa Monica\nmall and the famous pier. We visited Hollywood, Rodeo Drive and went to\nUniversal Studios on the weekend. Along with a Dutch colleague, we went to\nLong Beach and visited the Queen Mary.\n\nThe Dutch colleague told me he had access to Unix source code, and promised to\nsend me a tape (he did).\n\nI really enjoyed my time in Los Angeles, but was unused to American food\nserving sizes. Initially, I tucked in greedily in every meal, but by the end\nof the week both my colleague and I were really full and we had both put on\na lot of weight.\n\nI woke up one night sweating and with heart palpitations. In panic, I called\nfor a doctor. He said I had high blood pressure and prescribed pills. I\ncouldn't believe it - I was not even 30 and already had health problems.\n\nAfter that I wanted to cut down on food intake. But it was impossible. We\ndecided to have salad one night. It came in a big bowl with grilled chicken\npieces and what seemed like a whole can of mayonnaise.\n\nWe went Japanese the next night because we were under the impression the\nJapanese were into small portions and dainty food. Stupidly, I ordered\nchicken teriyaki and my colleague ordered beef. When the meal arrived, we\nboth laughed. I was given half a chicken and my friend had maybe 1kg of beef!\n\nAfter my return from my overseas trip, it was back to work. I remembered\nbeing an instructor providing training to staff at Newcastle Permanent\nBuilding Society. Because I couldn't drive, I flew to Newcastle and felt\nimportant. I got along well with the CIO, and he confided to me that he\nwas worried about performance issues on Oracle and he was aware I had some\nexperience with Oracle.\n\nI asked him what his concerns were. It turned out he started as a programmer\nfor IBM mainframes, and he used to write code that optimised disk access\nbased on the rotation speed of the disk (so that the next block read would\nhappen to align with where the head would likely to be situated).\n\nI said to him computer performance and disk technology had improved a lot and\nthere really wasn't any need to do optimisations like that. He was dubious.\nSo I said it's actually not possible to do those kind of optimisations because\ndisk drives reported a logical geometry rather than a true physical geometry.\nWith caching and newer density based writing mechanisms, it is simply not\npossible or even desirable to optimise for disk rotation.\n\nI also remember trying to solve a particularly difficult customer situation.\nThe customer was a large women's clothing retail chain, and they had bought\na lot of machines and were suffering performance issues. The AT&T support staff\nweren't able to diagnose the issue and the customer was threatening to\nphysically throw the systems out the window if we didn't fix the problem.\n\nI was sent in to project manage the problem resolution. I had to deal with\nthe customer as well as interface with the support staff, who were not that\nhappy to deal with me since I was quite young.\n\nIt was also a particularly stressful time for me, because I was studying\nfor my Masters and exam time was coming up. In fact, I had to sit for the\nexam, and rush out immediately afterwards for a board meeting with the customer.\n\nIn the end, we managed to resolve the issue for the customer, who became\ngood friends with me. It was also fun chatting with the store buyers who were\nresponsible for determining what clothes the stores should stock. They were very\nhelpful in telling we what was in fashion and what was coming out of fashion.\nThey also told me the best places to eat for lunch.\n\nI remember working with many clients and loving the work. One client in\nparticular was a Bank trying to implement an asset/liability system for a\nclient. Because of my finance background, I was sent in to help them, initially\njust to gather business requirements. I got along well with both the IT\nteam and Treasury officers. I remember we had great difficulty exporting data\nfrom an HP 3000 series mainframe. It generated what seemed to be CSV, but the\nhigh bit was set for negative numbers which was definitely unusual. Nobody\ncould figure out how to import the file. I facilitated numerous discussions\nwith the vendor of the software, and they were not very helpful, apart from\nsaying we needed to convert the file to standard CSV.\n\nIn desperation, I wrote a small script in Perl. I managed\nto get Perl working on MS-DOS, and demonstrated that I was handling the high\nbits and converting to standard ASCII. I said it was only intended to be a\nproof of concept, and that they should not be relying on something written\nin Perl running on a PC. But they were so relieved I think they wanted to\nput it in production!\n\nAnother incident I remember from my time at the Bank was lunching in the\ncafeteria one day. An old man came up to me and asked if he could sit down\nwith me. I said yes, and we started chatting. He was very friendly, and\nkeen to know what I did and listened attentively. When we finished lunch, he\nwas very courteous and wished me well. Afterwards, someone came up to me\nand said \"I see Fred had a chat with you. There must be a board meeting today.\"\nIt turned out he was one of the founders of the Bank and was a board member.\n\nTowards the end of my career at AT&T I was unhappy. I was not getting along\nwith my direct manager, and he gave me a poor performance review simply because\nI was too busy with one client and could not take on another client. He\nlectured me on working smarter rather than harder and what he proposed was\nthat I should work full time with one client, and then spend the evenings with\nanother. In disgust, I decided to quit, and wrote a resignation letter late\none Friday evening knowing that no one would read it until Monday morning.\nI then packed up and headed for the lifts.\n\nI met the director of Professional Services in the lift. He immediately said\nto me \"Where are you going?\" In my innocence, I replied that I was heading\nhome. He then smiled and said \"No, I meant what job have you accepted?\" It\nturned out he had read my email. So I poured my frustrations to him.\n\nTo my surprise, he made a concerted effort to make me stay in the job over the\nnext few weeks. He offered me a promotion, a chance to work in the US, anything\nto make me stay. I was flattered, but I had already accepted another job offer\nand I could not go back on my word. He accepted that, but I sometimes wonder\nwhether I should have stayed.\n\n## Hewlett Packard\n\nI accepted a job as an Architecture Consultant, mainly because one of the\nthings AT&T introduced me to was the notion of strategic IT planning and\nenterprise architecture, and I quickly became a fan and an evangelist.\n\nThe woman who hired me was super impressive herself. Although an Australian,\nshe had worked for years in the US and was a keen sky jumper and mentioned\nin the Guinness Book of Records. She was also known as a Wonder Woman at\nHP and was highly respected.\n\nI had always wanted to work for HP, dating back to my high school years\nwhen I was exposed to and fell in love with HP calculators. HP was the\nbiggest Unix vendor in those days, and I wanted to continue my career with\nUnix.\n\nWorking at HP was a mixture for me. Although I had a chance to visit the\nfamous HP Labs in Palo Alto and also the Cupertino office (now the site for\nApple Campus), I did not get on well with some people at the local Australian\noffice, although I also made very good friends with others.\nHP also did not exactly know what to do with me.\n\nI also learnt to drive. My salary package included a company car, and I was\nnot allowed to swap it for cash. It was a requirement for me as a consultant\nto be able to drive to client premises. Also, HP was located at Macquarie\nPark, and in those days there were no easy public transport options to the\nHP office.\n\nI failed in my first driving test attempt, because I went through amber lights.\nOn my second attempt, the driving examiner flirted with me, which turned out\nto be good as he gave me a pass. Soon I was driving around in a brand new\nred Holden Commodore.\n\nOn my first trip to the US to visit HP corporate offices, I was told I needed\nto rent a car at the airport. HP does not reimburse taxi trips, as the HP\noffice is too far from the airport and car rentals were US\\$22 a day at HP\ncorporate rates.\n\nI said I was scared to drive on \"the wrong side of the road\", as I was barely\nout of my L plates. My colleagues assured me that I'll adapt quickly, but the\nhardest maneuvre to get used to is the left turn as I need to turn into the\nrightmost lane and force of habit will automatically make me veer left.\n\nThey said I had to execute three left turns in succession when leaving the\nHertz car rental lot, so that's plenty of practice.\n\nWhen I arrived at San Francisco, I rented the car from Hertz, and sure enough\nI had to do three left turns, which I managed to do carefully. I became\nmore confident. What my colleagues did not tell me though was that the road\nthen immediately ramps up to the freeway. Remember that scene from the film\nClueless when Cher and Dionne were screaming when they accidentally got onto\nthe freeway? Well, that was me, all the way to the hotel freeway exit.\n\nHowever, after a few weeks of driving, I became to used to it that I started\ndriving like a Sydney taxi driver, weaving in and out of lanes. It was a while\nbefore I realised Californians are much more relaxed on the road compared to\nSydneysiders and that I should really just calm down and chill out.\n\nI do remember attending an HP conference in Singapore. I was so excited I\nrang my parents and asked if they wanted to join me in Singapore. To my\nsurprise they accepted.\n\nThey asked me to book a room at the hotel I was staying. I went downstairs\nto reception, and was shocked to discover a night at the hotel was over S\\$300!\nI rang some nearby hotels, and they were equally expensive. Then I had a\nbrainwave. I rang the hotel, and asked them for the HP corporate rate. They\nquoted S\\$120! Wow, I never what a good discount corporates get on room rates!\nMy parents popped over for a day and we had a happy mini reunion.\n\nIn my last year working at HP, I was seconded to Boral for nearly a year.\nThey had migrated from HP 3000 to the Oracle Business Suite running on HP 9000\nUnix computers and they needed someone to mentor their staff and do some\narchitecture work for them. I joined their enterprise architecture team\nreporting to the head of Strategy and Architecture Peter Reynolds.\n\nI really enjoyed my time there. Peter was a great and enlightened manager and\nI really admired him and the way he worked - he was really empowering and\ntreated me no differently than his permanent staff. I helped them write a\nbusiness case to justify their massive hardware upgrade and successfully\npresented to the board. Both HP and Boral were really happy for me.\n\nThey had a new CIO, Mark Wright, who took me under his wing. He had an\nambitious plan to centralise Boral's computing into a massive new data centre\nlocated in Adelaide and he wanted me to help him write the business case.\n\n## Master of Applied Finance, Macquarie University\n\nSometime around my career at HP I completed my Master of Applied Finance.\nWe were the first set of students the course was offered to. I really enjoyed\nthe coursework, which had a mixture of students ranging from people who\nhad just completed their undergraduate degree to professionals who have\nworked in the finance industry for years.\n\nSomehow, I managed to top the class and was awarred the Banker's Prize from\nthe Institute of Bankers. The course was also taught in Singapore and I\nwas invited to meet the Singaporean students who came over to Australia\nto do the final weeks of their study.\n\n## MLC\n\nOne day, I received a phone call from a recruitment consultant. She asked me\nif I was interested in a project management opportunity. She said there was\na large financial institution who had outsourced their IT several years ago\nbut was looking to insource some capabilities and regrow their IT team.\n\nI said I was not interested in being a project manager, but I certainly was\nkeen to find out more about the organisation. I explained that my focus was\nenterprise architecture and I would be keen on an architecture role.\n\nNext thing I knew I was lined up for an interview. I assumed given my discussion\naround enterprise architecture it was for an architecture role so I accepted.\n\nImagine my surprise when I attended the interview, and Bob Kershaw asked me\nabout my project management skills. He explained that he was in charge of\nrebuilding the MLC IT organisation and he was looking initially for project\nmanagers to help plan the process. MLC was also hiring a CIO and a new IT\nleadership team.\n\nI explained to him I wasn't interested in becoming a project manager, and I\nam sorry for having wasted his time. Intrigued, he asked me what role I thought\nI was applying for.\n\nI ended up explaining to him the concept of enterprise architecture, what\nthe benefits might be for an organisation such as MLC, particularly one that\nwas essentially reinventing what IT might be. Of course, I was mainly quoting\ntextbook benefits, but I was passionate and really believed and he could see\nthe fire in my eyes.\n\nI left the interview expecting never to hear from MLC again, but they\ncontacted me several days later. Apparently Bob was very taken in by my\nevangelisation and had spoken to the CEO of MLC, Peter Scott.\n\nNext thing I knew I was lined up for a second interview, with Peter and\nDenis Curran, the global CIO of Lend Lease, MLC's parent company. I was\nasked to re-explain my views of enterprise architecture. They were\nvery attentive.\n\nBob then sneakily asked me to pretend I was an external consultant and\nbidding for a contract with MLC. How would I submit a tender offering my\nservices? I took up the challenge and wrote a detailed proposal outlining\nexact what I would do if I accepted a role in the organisation, what benefits\nI would bring, and how the organisation will improve.\n\nTo my surprise, they accepted my proposal, turned it into a job role, and\noffered me the job! I became MLC's first Head of Strategy and Architecture.\n\nI was still in my early 30s, with barely 10 years in the workforce,\nbut I have now landed a job as an executive in\na large financial institution, with an office and a personal assistant, and\neven car parking privileges. I felt like I had made it. I had a budget and\na team to recruit and manage.\n\nWe had also recently paid off our mortgage, so suddenly the money was flowing\nin. I was able to get a new car, and we started going on overseas holidays.\nFirst to the US for two weeks in 1998, then UK and Italy in 2000.\n\nI had a good career at MLC and made many lifelong friends. I was responsible\nfor the IT Strategy in 1998 and delivered an enterprise architecture to the\norganisation. I created a strategy and architecture team. I was very pleased\nthat an external audit of the organisation praised our team and the auditors\nit was one of the best examples of a functional architecture practice they\nhave seen. I started presenting at international conferences on enterprise\narchitecture.\n\nIn the year 2000, I attended the Lend Lease CIO Conference in Hong Kong. It was\nmy first time visiting Hong Kong since the 1980s, and not too long after\nChina's takeover of Hong Kong from British rule. I was surprised at how\nrun down Hong Kong looked. After that, I went across to the US to visit\nMicrosoft, Sun, Oracle, HP and IBM. It was my first time visiting HP as a\ncustomer rather than as an employee, and it was interesting.\n\nSoon afterwards, I was in Perth on a business trip. I finished my meetings\nearly, and decided to do some shopping in the city. I received a phone call\nfrom Michelle Tredenick, the CIO. She was looking for all the enterprise\narchitecture documents. I promised I'll send them to her as soon as I got\nback to the office. I guessed (correctly) we were being sold and she needed\nthe documents for the due diligence.\n\nSoon enough, Lend Lease announced they would sell MLC to the National Australia\nBank at a price of over A\\$4 billion.\n\n## National Australia Bank (NAB)\n\nI became part of the integration team merging the wealth management operations\nof NAB and MLC together in to a new organisation called NAB Wealth. After\nthat, I accepted a position as Head of Architecture at NAB Distribution, and\nthen later on worked as Head of Architecture for the retail bank.\n\nMy position was based in Melbourne, and my team was in Melbourne, but I was\nstill based in Sydney. To NAB's credit, they did not force me to relocate to\nMelbourne, but instead paid for weekly flights and accommodation.\n\nSo began a period of over three years when I became a regular commuter between\nSydney and Melbourne. I flew so often I earned Platinum status on Qantas and\nthe staff started calling me by name as soon as I came on board a flight.\n\nIn the evenings, to while away my time, I used to compose music and also studied\nJapanese. I became overweight from fine dining too many nights in a week.\n\nI remember working on the Group IT Strategy in 2005 and also leading the\nCorporate Centre IT Strategy in 2007.\n\nAround 2006, I went on a business trip to the US with a group of NAB colleagues.\nWe visited the usual technology vendors: Microsoft, Sun, Oracle, IBM. Towards\nthe end of the trip, I received a call from my manager saying I have been\nrequested to assist with the European wealth management strategy and instead\nof returning home, I should catch a flight to London.\n\nWhen I arrived in London, it was an unseasonably warm and sunny day in February.\nBirds were chirping, flowers were blooming at Buckingham Palace. Little did I\nrealise that would have been the only sunny day for the next 6-8 weeks. The\nrest of my stay was miserable, and I was homesick.\n\nNAB offices in London were located on Wood St, pretty much in centre of\nthe London financial district. It was located near the Moorgate on the old\nLondon Wall, and very close to St. Paul's. Also nearly was the famous\nBarbican Centre, known for having superb acoustics. I spent a lot of my\nevenings attendings concerts and operas at the Royal Festival Hall, Covent\nGarden and the famous St-Martin-in-the-Fields, also known for great acoustics.\n\nI also flew to Glasgow on the invitation of the Head of Architecture for\nClydesdale and Yorkshire banks. I enjoyed my time there, and was amused that\nthe taxi driver who took me to the airport for the return journey thought\nI was a local Scottish resident.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed my stay in London, in the end I was very homesick and\npleaded to be allowed to return home. My manager said that was awkward because\nthe UK management liked me and was requesting for an extension. I remember\ncrying and said I really miss my family.\n\n## ING Australia\n\nOne day I received a call from an executive search firm. They said there was\na position as Head of Strategy and Architecture for ING Australia coming up\nand whether I was interested.\n\nThey seemed to have done a lot of research on me. Without me saying a word,\nthey alredy knew my career history, and knew that I had been commuting to\nMelbourne weekly for the past 3 years. They guessed I was probably tired of\ntravelling and emphasised that the ING position will be Sydney based.\n\nOf course I was interested. I attended the interview, and discovered one\nof my interviewers was Greg Baster, who I had met previously at Lend Lease\nand I had spent a weekend with him in San Francisco touring the city when\nwe were both on a business trip to the US.\n\nI accepted the position, and soon was deep in a lot of work. The new CIO\nwanted to outsource the IT organisation, and the organisation was also\nin the middle of large eBusiness app design.\n\nI visited the ING regional headquarters at Hong Kong for a regional\narchitecture conference. It was the first time I had returned to Hong Kong\nafter the Lend Lease CIO conference in 2000, and I was pleasantly surprised\nto see that the intervening years had completely transformed the city state.\nIt is now a bustling metropolis with some amazing architecture and lots of\ngreat places to eat and shop. The ING office was located at IFC 2, which is\nabove the Hong Station Station with the express train to the airport.\n\nI felt like a jetsetter, checking in to my flight in the morning at Hong\nKong Station, then working at ING right up till 5pm, then casually boarded\nthe Airport Express carrying nothing but a handbag and satchel, to the lounge\nto have a shower and meal before boarding the plane home.\n\nI also went with a group of executives to a business trip to India to assess\npotential partners for outsourcing. It was a really interesting trip as I\nhave never been to India before. It was only a few weeks after the Mumbai\n2008 attacks, so security was very tight. We stayed at the Leela Palace hotel,\na luxury hotel set amongst a lovely garden complete with waterfalls and\nfountain. It really looked like a palace, and initially I thought it must\nbe centuries old, then I discovered it was built in 1986.\n\nWe visited Infosys at Bangalore. The Infosys campus looked like a theme park.\nWe found out later employees were allowed to bring their parents to stay at\nthe in-campus accommodation, so it was in fact run as a resort. Then we\nvisited Microsoft at Hyderabad, and a small software development company\nat Chennai that prided themselves on employing disabled people (or, as the\nfounder proudly says, \"differently abled\").\n\nUnfortunately, I caught a cold around this time, and could not shake it off.\nEventually it developed into pneumonia, and I could not really enter an\nair conditioned room without hugh coughing fits.\n\nThen the Global Financial Crisis came. People who do not work in the finance\nindustry probably don't really realise what a shock this was to the\nglobal finance community. People seemed to think the world was ending, and\nfinance will never be the same again.\n\nING in particular suffered badly. Their share price plummeted to only a few\ncents, and the call centre was swamped with retirees calling in to say they\nneed their distributions otherwise they will starve. It was not a good time\nfor everyone.\n\nING negotiated an exit for me, and I was glad because I could not get rid of\nthe pneumonia.\n\n## Cycling\n\nFor the next two years I did not work and focused on regaining my health. I was\noverweight, and sick, with high blood pressure and a fatty liver. My health\nproblems were affecting even my eyes - they became very astigmatic and I no\nlonger have 20/20 vision.\n\nI took up cycling again. I remember enjoying cycling when I was young, and I\nneeded a way to get fit.\n\nMy first ride, just up and down the street, was both elating and humbling.\nI rode down the street, not realising it was slightly downhill, and marveled\nat how easy cycling was. I barely needed to pedal, and I was going so fast.\nWhee!\n\nI then turned around at the end of the street and started cycling back. That's\nwhen I realised cycling was tough. I could barely rotate the pedals. Eventually\nI gave up and walked up the hill. That was very humbling, and told me how\nunfit I was.\n\nOver the next few months, I cycled every day and gradually improved my fitness\nand strength. I started cycling longer distances: to North Sydney and back,\nto Eastwood, around Sydney Olympic Park, and even around Lake Burley Griffin\nin Canberra (which has long been on the bucket list for me).\n\nI soon became brave enough to consider joining cycling groups. The first bunch\nride I did was shameful. The guys laughed at me when they saw my hybrid bicycle\nand said I would not be able to keep up with them but I could certainly try.\n\nAs soon as they left, they immediately dropped me. I valiantly tried to follow\nthem all the way to Roseville Bridge, and realised it was hopeless, and turned\naround to cycle back.\n\nMy next attempt at joining a cycling bunch was a little better. They started\nat 6:30am, which was just after sunrise, so I had to cycle to the starting\npoint in darknesss. I had lights on the bicyle, but they don't work on corners.\nI made the mistake of cycling there on a bike path, and crashed my bike\nnavigating the corner. So I made it to the start with bleeding legs, which\nwasn't a good impression. The ride leader was so concerned with my\ninexperience he opted to stay with me for the entire ride just to make sure\nI was okay. Luckily I managed to survive the ride to Taronga Zoo and back\nreasonably well.\n\nAfter that, I was a regular participant on bunch rides on my Giant hybrid.\nEventually I decided I needed to upgrade to a real road bike, so I bought\na second hand Giant TCR from Ebay.\n\nI had developed the cycling bug. I upgraded all the components of that bike\nover time, and continued to ride it for more than 5 years. I eventually\nprogressed from riding with the \"C\" group (slowest) to the \"A\" group. I was\ncycling 400-500 km per week. I was really fit.\n\n## Hello Tham\n\nHowever, the money was starting to run out. I did some day trading and made\nsome money, and this convinced me to sell our investment property and go\nall in on shares and fixed income. This helped stabilised our finances but\nI realise I need to get a job.\n\nI reconnected with a friend who I met when he was working at Accenture and\nassisting NAB with the IT Strategy in 2007. He managed to get me a few days\nconsulting for the University of New England. That was a nice taste, but\nI really needed more money.\n\nA former MLC colleague had recently become the CIO at Transfield Services.\nHe invited me to do some consulting to help define an IT Strategy and\nmigration roadmap to assist the organisation in getting approval for an\nSAP implementation. It was supposed to be 6-12 weeks of work, because I\nliked because it was just enough money to buy a new bicycle. I ended up\nworking there for over 6 years, in various roles.\n\nI then started my own consulting company, called Hello Tham, and did various\nconsulting assignments for Broadspectrum as well as TransportNSW.","src/content/bio/work.md","237003466784c809",{"html":353,"metadata":354},"\u003Cp>This section is not a resume. If you want to read my resume, you can visit\nmy profile on \u003Ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/christham/\">LinkedIn\u003C/a>. It is a\nanecdotal retelling of highlights from my work life from a personal perspective.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"option-technology\">Option Technology\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Bain &#x26; Co. (now part of Deutsche Bank) did offer me a permanent job after I\ngraduated, but I was keen to explore other options. I was attracted to a\nfintech startup called Option Technology - they were a boutique options\ntrading firm that specialised in manufacturing synthetic options allowing\ntheir clients to hedge their foreign exchange exposure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The phrase “fintech startup” did not exist back then but the company definitely\nfitted the label. It was founded by a charismatic person, Ralph McKay and his\nwife Nanette. The hiring process included a spiritual reading of my\nsoul by Ralph’s guru. I decided I instantly liked the McKays.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The company had won a contract to productionise the software they used to\nfor trading and portfolio management of options, and I was hired as an analyst.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The work involved translating the mathematical concepts behind option pricing\nand so called “Greek letter” derived parameters used for risk measurement and\nmanagement. We used a series of Sun workstations to do the computations, and\nI used my knowledge of distributed computing to distribute the workload across\nthe workstations. I ended up writing a technical paper on it which was\npublished on SunTech Journal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My work colleagues were all recent graduates from the University of Sydney.\nLike Bain &#x26; Co, they would only hire people from USyd and never from UNSW.\nThe old students university network operated very strongly back then. Some\ninstitutions even cared which private school you went to.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It was my first real job, and I loved it. I bought a compact camera, and used\nit to take photos when we travelled, which was seldom because I couldn’t quite\nafford plane tickets. We had just bought an apartment, interest rates were\nsky high at 17%, and almost all our spare cash went towards paying the\nmortgage.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All the coding was done in C, a language I was familiar with. The company\nwanted to switch to C++. Object oriented computing was a fad in those days,\nand everyone wanted to jump on the bandwagon. The company sent us to C++\ntraining classes, taught by none other than Bjarne Strostrup, the inventor\nof the language.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I hated C++, and had long conversations with Bjarne. He accepted my criticisms\nbut said C++ was a compromise given the need to transpile to C. He said C++\nwill improve once there were object code compilers. To this date, I dislike\nC++ and have never written a line of code in it. I also dislike all the C++\nrelated languages like Java and Objective C.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Unfortunately, Option Technology ran into financial difficulty because the\nventure capital dried out, and they were not able to get a product to market\nin time. Sadly, I had to find another job.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"state-bank-victoria\">State Bank Victoria\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I soon found a position as an analyst at the Treasury Department of State\nBank Victoria (SBV). Even though the bank was based in Melbourne, they had\npurchased Australian Bank (which was primarily a trading bank), and retained\nall the trading functions which were in Sydney.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I continued my work on option pricing and risk management there. I was\nemployed by the Treasury Division, and not part of the IT department, so I\nhad a lot of freedom that I probably would not have if I worked in IT. For\nexample, I had root access to the production Pyramid Unix supercomputer,\nbecause they just trusted me. I definitely had full access to my Sun 3/60\nworkstation, and completely replaced the horrible Sun graphical user interface\nwith X Windows, which I compiled myself, and I downloaded lots of source code\nfrom USENet, including Perl, gcc, bash and the first version of Python.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of my duties was to write a simple trading system in Oracle, as the bank\nhad purchased Oracle but it was a white elephant as all the production system\nused C-ISAM files. I wrote a very simple set of screens, and was made the\nOracle database administrator. I became super nerdy and managed to configure\nOracle to use raw partitions to store database tables, something brand new\nat the time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Once, I completely botched up an Oracle upgrade, resulting in a loss of about\n3 days of transactions. I cried, and I was sure I will be fired. To my surprise,\nthey were okay about it. All the traders supported me by staying back to\nre-enter the transactions manually and I was glad I kept my job. I learnt a\nbig lesson that day.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I co authored a technical paper on Unix security, which advocated for an\nimproved Unix password system as the current one (based on a slightly broken\n3DES implementation) is to easy to compromise using brute force password\nsearching. To prove the point, I wrote a password guesser that took advantage\nof large memory on modern Unix computers and as a test managed to hack into\nseveral accounts at one of the computers at the University of Sydney.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Several days later, I received a call from the system administrator at the\nuniversity. They had “discovered” my hacking efforts. I explained the situation.\nI think they forgave me. Then they said in the future if I wanted to use\ntheir computer, I could get my own account for $10 a month. They offered\ndial up IP internet services!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So my home computer managed to be one of the first personal computers\nconnected to the Internet, well before the word was even known to the public.\nIt was fun. I ran NetBSD at home, and was able to sync to the official\nrepository, and effectively ran a rolling release distribution, keeping\nmy computer up to date with the latest version.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Even though I was still relatively inexperienced, my position at SBV was\nreasonably highly paid compared to other staff at the Bank. I was graded a Level\n4 which was equivalent to a bank manager in status. I was very surprised when\nI visited the head office in Melbourne for a training course that I was allowed\nto dine in the executive room with full table service. I really thought I had\nmade it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>State Bank Victoria went through a crisis in 1990. Irresponsible lending by\na subsidiary (Tricontinental) led to its collapse, and it had to be rescued\nby the Commonwealth Bank that bought it for just over $2 billion. I think I\neven took a photocopy of the bankers cheque for the sale amount.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Soon I was working for the Commonwealth Bank in the large Treasury office\n(it seemed like the size of a football field) at Harrington St. I did not\nenjoy working here. Commonwealth Bank was owned by the Federal Government and\nit was like working in the public service - people had tenure and the whole\nplace was very bureaucratic. Due to union regulations, staff were forced to\ntake morning and afternoon breaks. I wanted to work through, but was politely\nescorted out where I was made to sit in the courtyard for 15 minutes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My boss knew how unhappy I was and sent me to a “training course” that included\nboth bank staff and their key clients. It was supposedly about “options” which\nI thought I already knew. The course was a week long stay in house at the\nbank’s exclusive executive training facility at St. Ives.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I wasn’t happy to attend. I was studying for a Graduate Diploma in\nInvestment Management at the Securities Insitute of Australia and I had an\nexam coming up right after the course. I needed valuable study time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I arrived by taxi at the training facility and immediately realised it was a\njunket offered as a incentive to corporate bank customers and regarded as a\nbit of a perk by staff. The “training” was minimal, it was all food and wine\nprovided in copious amounts. People were cuddling up to each other, it was\nlike a night in Hugh Hefner’s mansion. I locked myself in my room and started\nstudying.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When I came back, my boss winked at me and asked me if I had a “great time.” I\nwasn’t sure how to respond, so I meekly smiled.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"ncratt\">NCR/AT&#x26;T\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I was still unhappy at the Bank and decided to look for another job. I saw\na job ad looking for “Unix System Engineers,” Since I loved Unix, I thought\nthis was a great opportunity to do what I love for a living, just like the\nfun times I had at Bain &#x26; Co.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I applied, and to my surprise was accepted, mainly because the interviewer\ngot along really well with me. I was graded a Level 5, which was quite a\nsenior grade, and some of the existing system engineers who were older than\nme were a bit envious.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Soon after, AT&#x26;T bought NCR and I was actually excited. I am working for the\ncompany that invented Unix!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I had a great time working at the company and in hindsight it was a great\nplace to work. I made lifelong friends, and the company was willing to pay\nfor my Masters of Applied Finance degree that I had enrolled in. For my\nvarious contributions, I was awarded Employee of the Month twice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The company sent me on my first overseas business trip. I went to Copenhagen\nfor a week training, and it was a very unique experience. I experienced Europe\nfor the very first time, and I made friends with a colleague from Turkey and\ntogether she and I explored Copenhagen in our spare time and took lots of\nphotos. I also got along well with some Italian colleagues and we went out\nto visit Tivoli. On my last day, my Turkish colleague and I took a train to\nvisit Krönborg, also known as “Hamlet’s Castle” as Shakespeare’s play was\nsupposedly set there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After that I went to Los Angeles for two weeks training. I was with another\nAussie colleague from the Brisbane office. He had hired a car, and because\nI did not drive, he would take me everywhere. We had a great time trying out\ndifferent restaurants for dinner, and going shopping and visitng famous places\nthat I’ve only seen in films, like the Beverly Hills Center and Santa Monica\nmall and the famous pier. We visited Hollywood, Rodeo Drive and went to\nUniversal Studios on the weekend. Along with a Dutch colleague, we went to\nLong Beach and visited the Queen Mary.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Dutch colleague told me he had access to Unix source code, and promised to\nsend me a tape (he did).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I really enjoyed my time in Los Angeles, but was unused to American food\nserving sizes. Initially, I tucked in greedily in every meal, but by the end\nof the week both my colleague and I were really full and we had both put on\na lot of weight.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I woke up one night sweating and with heart palpitations. In panic, I called\nfor a doctor. He said I had high blood pressure and prescribed pills. I\ncouldn’t believe it - I was not even 30 and already had health problems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After that I wanted to cut down on food intake. But it was impossible. We\ndecided to have salad one night. It came in a big bowl with grilled chicken\npieces and what seemed like a whole can of mayonnaise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We went Japanese the next night because we were under the impression the\nJapanese were into small portions and dainty food. Stupidly, I ordered\nchicken teriyaki and my colleague ordered beef. When the meal arrived, we\nboth laughed. I was given half a chicken and my friend had maybe 1kg of beef!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After my return from my overseas trip, it was back to work. I remembered\nbeing an instructor providing training to staff at Newcastle Permanent\nBuilding Society. Because I couldn’t drive, I flew to Newcastle and felt\nimportant. I got along well with the CIO, and he confided to me that he\nwas worried about performance issues on Oracle and he was aware I had some\nexperience with Oracle.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I asked him what his concerns were. It turned out he started as a programmer\nfor IBM mainframes, and he used to write code that optimised disk access\nbased on the rotation speed of the disk (so that the next block read would\nhappen to align with where the head would likely to be situated).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I said to him computer performance and disk technology had improved a lot and\nthere really wasn’t any need to do optimisations like that. He was dubious.\nSo I said it’s actually not possible to do those kind of optimisations because\ndisk drives reported a logical geometry rather than a true physical geometry.\nWith caching and newer density based writing mechanisms, it is simply not\npossible or even desirable to optimise for disk rotation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I also remember trying to solve a particularly difficult customer situation.\nThe customer was a large women’s clothing retail chain, and they had bought\na lot of machines and were suffering performance issues. The AT&#x26;T support staff\nweren’t able to diagnose the issue and the customer was threatening to\nphysically throw the systems out the window if we didn’t fix the problem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was sent in to project manage the problem resolution. I had to deal with\nthe customer as well as interface with the support staff, who were not that\nhappy to deal with me since I was quite young.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It was also a particularly stressful time for me, because I was studying\nfor my Masters and exam time was coming up. In fact, I had to sit for the\nexam, and rush out immediately afterwards for a board meeting with the customer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the end, we managed to resolve the issue for the customer, who became\ngood friends with me. It was also fun chatting with the store buyers who were\nresponsible for determining what clothes the stores should stock. They were very\nhelpful in telling we what was in fashion and what was coming out of fashion.\nThey also told me the best places to eat for lunch.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I remember working with many clients and loving the work. One client in\nparticular was a Bank trying to implement an asset/liability system for a\nclient. Because of my finance background, I was sent in to help them, initially\njust to gather business requirements. I got along well with both the IT\nteam and Treasury officers. I remember we had great difficulty exporting data\nfrom an HP 3000 series mainframe. It generated what seemed to be CSV, but the\nhigh bit was set for negative numbers which was definitely unusual. Nobody\ncould figure out how to import the file. I facilitated numerous discussions\nwith the vendor of the software, and they were not very helpful, apart from\nsaying we needed to convert the file to standard CSV.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In desperation, I wrote a small script in Perl. I managed\nto get Perl working on MS-DOS, and demonstrated that I was handling the high\nbits and converting to standard ASCII. I said it was only intended to be a\nproof of concept, and that they should not be relying on something written\nin Perl running on a PC. But they were so relieved I think they wanted to\nput it in production!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another incident I remember from my time at the Bank was lunching in the\ncafeteria one day. An old man came up to me and asked if he could sit down\nwith me. I said yes, and we started chatting. He was very friendly, and\nkeen to know what I did and listened attentively. When we finished lunch, he\nwas very courteous and wished me well. Afterwards, someone came up to me\nand said “I see Fred had a chat with you. There must be a board meeting today.”\nIt turned out he was one of the founders of the Bank and was a board member.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Towards the end of my career at AT&#x26;T I was unhappy. I was not getting along\nwith my direct manager, and he gave me a poor performance review simply because\nI was too busy with one client and could not take on another client. He\nlectured me on working smarter rather than harder and what he proposed was\nthat I should work full time with one client, and then spend the evenings with\nanother. In disgust, I decided to quit, and wrote a resignation letter late\none Friday evening knowing that no one would read it until Monday morning.\nI then packed up and headed for the lifts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I met the director of Professional Services in the lift. He immediately said\nto me “Where are you going?” In my innocence, I replied that I was heading\nhome. He then smiled and said “No, I meant what job have you accepted?” It\nturned out he had read my email. So I poured my frustrations to him.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To my surprise, he made a concerted effort to make me stay in the job over the\nnext few weeks. He offered me a promotion, a chance to work in the US, anything\nto make me stay. I was flattered, but I had already accepted another job offer\nand I could not go back on my word. He accepted that, but I sometimes wonder\nwhether I should have stayed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"hewlett-packard\">Hewlett Packard\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I accepted a job as an Architecture Consultant, mainly because one of the\nthings AT&#x26;T introduced me to was the notion of strategic IT planning and\nenterprise architecture, and I quickly became a fan and an evangelist.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The woman who hired me was super impressive herself. Although an Australian,\nshe had worked for years in the US and was a keen sky jumper and mentioned\nin the Guinness Book of Records. She was also known as a Wonder Woman at\nHP and was highly respected.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I had always wanted to work for HP, dating back to my high school years\nwhen I was exposed to and fell in love with HP calculators. HP was the\nbiggest Unix vendor in those days, and I wanted to continue my career with\nUnix.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Working at HP was a mixture for me. Although I had a chance to visit the\nfamous HP Labs in Palo Alto and also the Cupertino office (now the site for\nApple Campus), I did not get on well with some people at the local Australian\noffice, although I also made very good friends with others.\nHP also did not exactly know what to do with me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I also learnt to drive. My salary package included a company car, and I was\nnot allowed to swap it for cash. It was a requirement for me as a consultant\nto be able to drive to client premises. Also, HP was located at Macquarie\nPark, and in those days there were no easy public transport options to the\nHP office.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I failed in my first driving test attempt, because I went through amber lights.\nOn my second attempt, the driving examiner flirted with me, which turned out\nto be good as he gave me a pass. Soon I was driving around in a brand new\nred Holden Commodore.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On my first trip to the US to visit HP corporate offices, I was told I needed\nto rent a car at the airport. HP does not reimburse taxi trips, as the HP\noffice is too far from the airport and car rentals were US$22 a day at HP\ncorporate rates.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I said I was scared to drive on “the wrong side of the road”, as I was barely\nout of my L plates. My colleagues assured me that I’ll adapt quickly, but the\nhardest maneuvre to get used to is the left turn as I need to turn into the\nrightmost lane and force of habit will automatically make me veer left.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They said I had to execute three left turns in succession when leaving the\nHertz car rental lot, so that’s plenty of practice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When I arrived at San Francisco, I rented the car from Hertz, and sure enough\nI had to do three left turns, which I managed to do carefully. I became\nmore confident. What my colleagues did not tell me though was that the road\nthen immediately ramps up to the freeway. Remember that scene from the film\nClueless when Cher and Dionne were screaming when they accidentally got onto\nthe freeway? Well, that was me, all the way to the hotel freeway exit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, after a few weeks of driving, I became to used to it that I started\ndriving like a Sydney taxi driver, weaving in and out of lanes. It was a while\nbefore I realised Californians are much more relaxed on the road compared to\nSydneysiders and that I should really just calm down and chill out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I do remember attending an HP conference in Singapore. I was so excited I\nrang my parents and asked if they wanted to join me in Singapore. To my\nsurprise they accepted.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They asked me to book a room at the hotel I was staying. I went downstairs\nto reception, and was shocked to discover a night at the hotel was over S$300!\nI rang some nearby hotels, and they were equally expensive. Then I had a\nbrainwave. I rang the hotel, and asked them for the HP corporate rate. They\nquoted S$120! Wow, I never what a good discount corporates get on room rates!\nMy parents popped over for a day and we had a happy mini reunion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In my last year working at HP, I was seconded to Boral for nearly a year.\nThey had migrated from HP 3000 to the Oracle Business Suite running on HP 9000\nUnix computers and they needed someone to mentor their staff and do some\narchitecture work for them. I joined their enterprise architecture team\nreporting to the head of Strategy and Architecture Peter Reynolds.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I really enjoyed my time there. Peter was a great and enlightened manager and\nI really admired him and the way he worked - he was really empowering and\ntreated me no differently than his permanent staff. I helped them write a\nbusiness case to justify their massive hardware upgrade and successfully\npresented to the board. Both HP and Boral were really happy for me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They had a new CIO, Mark Wright, who took me under his wing. He had an\nambitious plan to centralise Boral’s computing into a massive new data centre\nlocated in Adelaide and he wanted me to help him write the business case.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"master-of-applied-finance-macquarie-university\">Master of Applied Finance, Macquarie University\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Sometime around my career at HP I completed my Master of Applied Finance.\nWe were the first set of students the course was offered to. I really enjoyed\nthe coursework, which had a mixture of students ranging from people who\nhad just completed their undergraduate degree to professionals who have\nworked in the finance industry for years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Somehow, I managed to top the class and was awarred the Banker’s Prize from\nthe Institute of Bankers. The course was also taught in Singapore and I\nwas invited to meet the Singaporean students who came over to Australia\nto do the final weeks of their study.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"mlc\">MLC\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>One day, I received a phone call from a recruitment consultant. She asked me\nif I was interested in a project management opportunity. She said there was\na large financial institution who had outsourced their IT several years ago\nbut was looking to insource some capabilities and regrow their IT team.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I said I was not interested in being a project manager, but I certainly was\nkeen to find out more about the organisation. I explained that my focus was\nenterprise architecture and I would be keen on an architecture role.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Next thing I knew I was lined up for an interview. I assumed given my discussion\naround enterprise architecture it was for an architecture role so I accepted.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Imagine my surprise when I attended the interview, and Bob Kershaw asked me\nabout my project management skills. He explained that he was in charge of\nrebuilding the MLC IT organisation and he was looking initially for project\nmanagers to help plan the process. MLC was also hiring a CIO and a new IT\nleadership team.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I explained to him I wasn’t interested in becoming a project manager, and I\nam sorry for having wasted his time. Intrigued, he asked me what role I thought\nI was applying for.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I ended up explaining to him the concept of enterprise architecture, what\nthe benefits might be for an organisation such as MLC, particularly one that\nwas essentially reinventing what IT might be. Of course, I was mainly quoting\ntextbook benefits, but I was passionate and really believed and he could see\nthe fire in my eyes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I left the interview expecting never to hear from MLC again, but they\ncontacted me several days later. Apparently Bob was very taken in by my\nevangelisation and had spoken to the CEO of MLC, Peter Scott.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Next thing I knew I was lined up for a second interview, with Peter and\nDenis Curran, the global CIO of Lend Lease, MLC’s parent company. I was\nasked to re-explain my views of enterprise architecture. They were\nvery attentive.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Bob then sneakily asked me to pretend I was an external consultant and\nbidding for a contract with MLC. How would I submit a tender offering my\nservices? I took up the challenge and wrote a detailed proposal outlining\nexact what I would do if I accepted a role in the organisation, what benefits\nI would bring, and how the organisation will improve.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To my surprise, they accepted my proposal, turned it into a job role, and\noffered me the job! I became MLC’s first Head of Strategy and Architecture.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was still in my early 30s, with barely 10 years in the workforce,\nbut I have now landed a job as an executive in\na large financial institution, with an office and a personal assistant, and\neven car parking privileges. I felt like I had made it. I had a budget and\na team to recruit and manage.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We had also recently paid off our mortgage, so suddenly the money was flowing\nin. I was able to get a new car, and we started going on overseas holidays.\nFirst to the US for two weeks in 1998, then UK and Italy in 2000.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I had a good career at MLC and made many lifelong friends. I was responsible\nfor the IT Strategy in 1998 and delivered an enterprise architecture to the\norganisation. I created a strategy and architecture team. I was very pleased\nthat an external audit of the organisation praised our team and the auditors\nit was one of the best examples of a functional architecture practice they\nhave seen. I started presenting at international conferences on enterprise\narchitecture.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the year 2000, I attended the Lend Lease CIO Conference in Hong Kong. It was\nmy first time visiting Hong Kong since the 1980s, and not too long after\nChina’s takeover of Hong Kong from British rule. I was surprised at how\nrun down Hong Kong looked. After that, I went across to the US to visit\nMicrosoft, Sun, Oracle, HP and IBM. It was my first time visiting HP as a\ncustomer rather than as an employee, and it was interesting.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Soon afterwards, I was in Perth on a business trip. I finished my meetings\nearly, and decided to do some shopping in the city. I received a phone call\nfrom Michelle Tredenick, the CIO. She was looking for all the enterprise\narchitecture documents. I promised I’ll send them to her as soon as I got\nback to the office. I guessed (correctly) we were being sold and she needed\nthe documents for the due diligence.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Soon enough, Lend Lease announced they would sell MLC to the National Australia\nBank at a price of over A$4 billion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"national-australia-bank-nab\">National Australia Bank (NAB)\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I became part of the integration team merging the wealth management operations\nof NAB and MLC together in to a new organisation called NAB Wealth. After\nthat, I accepted a position as Head of Architecture at NAB Distribution, and\nthen later on worked as Head of Architecture for the retail bank.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My position was based in Melbourne, and my team was in Melbourne, but I was\nstill based in Sydney. To NAB’s credit, they did not force me to relocate to\nMelbourne, but instead paid for weekly flights and accommodation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So began a period of over three years when I became a regular commuter between\nSydney and Melbourne. I flew so often I earned Platinum status on Qantas and\nthe staff started calling me by name as soon as I came on board a flight.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the evenings, to while away my time, I used to compose music and also studied\nJapanese. I became overweight from fine dining too many nights in a week.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I remember working on the Group IT Strategy in 2005 and also leading the\nCorporate Centre IT Strategy in 2007.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Around 2006, I went on a business trip to the US with a group of NAB colleagues.\nWe visited the usual technology vendors: Microsoft, Sun, Oracle, IBM. Towards\nthe end of the trip, I received a call from my manager saying I have been\nrequested to assist with the European wealth management strategy and instead\nof returning home, I should catch a flight to London.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When I arrived in London, it was an unseasonably warm and sunny day in February.\nBirds were chirping, flowers were blooming at Buckingham Palace. Little did I\nrealise that would have been the only sunny day for the next 6-8 weeks. The\nrest of my stay was miserable, and I was homesick.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>NAB offices in London were located on Wood St, pretty much in centre of\nthe London financial district. It was located near the Moorgate on the old\nLondon Wall, and very close to St. Paul’s. Also nearly was the famous\nBarbican Centre, known for having superb acoustics. I spent a lot of my\nevenings attendings concerts and operas at the Royal Festival Hall, Covent\nGarden and the famous St-Martin-in-the-Fields, also known for great acoustics.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I also flew to Glasgow on the invitation of the Head of Architecture for\nClydesdale and Yorkshire banks. I enjoyed my time there, and was amused that\nthe taxi driver who took me to the airport for the return journey thought\nI was a local Scottish resident.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although I enjoyed my stay in London, in the end I was very homesick and\npleaded to be allowed to return home. My manager said that was awkward because\nthe UK management liked me and was requesting for an extension. I remember\ncrying and said I really miss my family.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"ing-australia\">ING Australia\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>One day I received a call from an executive search firm. They said there was\na position as Head of Strategy and Architecture for ING Australia coming up\nand whether I was interested.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They seemed to have done a lot of research on me. Without me saying a word,\nthey alredy knew my career history, and knew that I had been commuting to\nMelbourne weekly for the past 3 years. They guessed I was probably tired of\ntravelling and emphasised that the ING position will be Sydney based.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Of course I was interested. I attended the interview, and discovered one\nof my interviewers was Greg Baster, who I had met previously at Lend Lease\nand I had spent a weekend with him in San Francisco touring the city when\nwe were both on a business trip to the US.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I accepted the position, and soon was deep in a lot of work. The new CIO\nwanted to outsource the IT organisation, and the organisation was also\nin the middle of large eBusiness app design.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I visited the ING regional headquarters at Hong Kong for a regional\narchitecture conference. It was the first time I had returned to Hong Kong\nafter the Lend Lease CIO conference in 2000, and I was pleasantly surprised\nto see that the intervening years had completely transformed the city state.\nIt is now a bustling metropolis with some amazing architecture and lots of\ngreat places to eat and shop. The ING office was located at IFC 2, which is\nabove the Hong Station Station with the express train to the airport.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I felt like a jetsetter, checking in to my flight in the morning at Hong\nKong Station, then working at ING right up till 5pm, then casually boarded\nthe Airport Express carrying nothing but a handbag and satchel, to the lounge\nto have a shower and meal before boarding the plane home.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I also went with a group of executives to a business trip to India to assess\npotential partners for outsourcing. It was a really interesting trip as I\nhave never been to India before. It was only a few weeks after the Mumbai\n2008 attacks, so security was very tight. We stayed at the Leela Palace hotel,\na luxury hotel set amongst a lovely garden complete with waterfalls and\nfountain. It really looked like a palace, and initially I thought it must\nbe centuries old, then I discovered it was built in 1986.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We visited Infosys at Bangalore. The Infosys campus looked like a theme park.\nWe found out later employees were allowed to bring their parents to stay at\nthe in-campus accommodation, so it was in fact run as a resort. Then we\nvisited Microsoft at Hyderabad, and a small software development company\nat Chennai that prided themselves on employing disabled people (or, as the\nfounder proudly says, “differently abled”).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Unfortunately, I caught a cold around this time, and could not shake it off.\nEventually it developed into pneumonia, and I could not really enter an\nair conditioned room without hugh coughing fits.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then the Global Financial Crisis came. People who do not work in the finance\nindustry probably don’t really realise what a shock this was to the\nglobal finance community. People seemed to think the world was ending, and\nfinance will never be the same again.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>ING in particular suffered badly. Their share price plummeted to only a few\ncents, and the call centre was swamped with retirees calling in to say they\nneed their distributions otherwise they will starve. It was not a good time\nfor everyone.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>ING negotiated an exit for me, and I was glad because I could not get rid of\nthe pneumonia.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"cycling\">Cycling\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>For the next two years I did not work and focused on regaining my health. I was\noverweight, and sick, with high blood pressure and a fatty liver. My health\nproblems were affecting even my eyes - they became very astigmatic and I no\nlonger have 20/20 vision.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I took up cycling again. I remember enjoying cycling when I was young, and I\nneeded a way to get fit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My first ride, just up and down the street, was both elating and humbling.\nI rode down the street, not realising it was slightly downhill, and marveled\nat how easy cycling was. I barely needed to pedal, and I was going so fast.\nWhee!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I then turned around at the end of the street and started cycling back. That’s\nwhen I realised cycling was tough. I could barely rotate the pedals. Eventually\nI gave up and walked up the hill. That was very humbling, and told me how\nunfit I was.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Over the next few months, I cycled every day and gradually improved my fitness\nand strength. I started cycling longer distances: to North Sydney and back,\nto Eastwood, around Sydney Olympic Park, and even around Lake Burley Griffin\nin Canberra (which has long been on the bucket list for me).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I soon became brave enough to consider joining cycling groups. The first bunch\nride I did was shameful. The guys laughed at me when they saw my hybrid bicycle\nand said I would not be able to keep up with them but I could certainly try.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As soon as they left, they immediately dropped me. I valiantly tried to follow\nthem all the way to Roseville Bridge, and realised it was hopeless, and turned\naround to cycle back.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My next attempt at joining a cycling bunch was a little better. They started\nat 6:30am, which was just after sunrise, so I had to cycle to the starting\npoint in darknesss. I had lights on the bicyle, but they don’t work on corners.\nI made the mistake of cycling there on a bike path, and crashed my bike\nnavigating the corner. So I made it to the start with bleeding legs, which\nwasn’t a good impression. The ride leader was so concerned with my\ninexperience he opted to stay with me for the entire ride just to make sure\nI was okay. Luckily I managed to survive the ride to Taronga Zoo and back\nreasonably well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After that, I was a regular participant on bunch rides on my Giant hybrid.\nEventually I decided I needed to upgrade to a real road bike, so I bought\na second hand Giant TCR from Ebay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I had developed the cycling bug. I upgraded all the components of that bike\nover time, and continued to ride it for more than 5 years. I eventually\nprogressed from riding with the “C” group (slowest) to the “A” group. I was\ncycling 400-500 km per week. I was really fit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"hello-tham\">Hello Tham\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>However, the money was starting to run out.

I have permission from the\nauthor of that website (Henry Tom) for the following extract (I have converted\nmentions of the \"Tom\" surname to \"Tham\" for clarity)._\n\n---\n\nInformation on the Tham clan are found in genealogy documents, books on Chinese surnames, legends, and clan folklore. This scattered information, however, needs to be systematically compiled, integrated, and translated from these Chinese sources into an authoritative treatise. Beyond the difficulties associated with Chinese-English translations, historical discrepancies also require adjudication and explanation. These notes on the Tham clan should be considered as a composite of English translations of some of the Chinese sources. As initial notes, there is, hopefully, a recognition and acceptance that they are imperfect, provisional, and a work in progress that is frequently updated. Currenly, the intent is just to provide an general overview and coherent understanding of the origins and history of the Tham clan.\n\nIn general, there seem to be two prevailing views on the origins and history of the Tham clan.\n\n## Tom (Tham) Origins from Four Brothers\n\nThe first view is the basis for the Chew Lun Association ( 昭 倫 公 所 ) This is a four clan association that includes the four surnames--Hom (譚 ), Tom ( 談 ), Huey ( 許 ), Der ( 謝 ). The characters for all the surnames used the radical yan 言 on the left. These surnames were all alleged to be derived from a descendant of Chiang Tai Kung ( 姜 太 公 ) (1210-1120BC), one of the most celebrated generals in Chinese history and worshipped even today in China as a god who protects homes and shops. This descendant, Wei, was the father of four sons. As they were living in the times of political strife, Wei was afraid to bequeath his clan name to his progeny. He therefore only gave them first names, which were Hom, Tom, Huey and Der. When these sons grew up the father cautioned them about revealing their real clan name, but always come to the aid of each other. Later, these sons took their first names as family names, but always remembered their father's injunction to help each other. The Chew Lun four-family alliance came about many centuries later to reunite the descendants of the sons of Wei, who started out as blood brothers. The Tom, Hom, Huey and Tse clans are found throughout the world and there are also Chew Lun Association branches in many cities and countries. This was initially described under Clan Associations under Genealogy. This information was made available by Washington Tom Lee, Bet Lai, Him Mark Lai, and Lawrence Tom.\n\n![Provinces](/images/about/Provinces.jpg)\n![Henan Province](/images/about/HenanProvince.jpg)\n\n## Tham Origins in the North China Plain - [ Henan ( 河 南 ) and Shandong Provinces ( 山 東 ) ]\n\nThe second view includes Tham origins in the North China Plain ( 華北平原 ), also known as Zhongyuan, the Central Plain ( 中原 ), considered to be the cradle of Chinese civilization, - specifically notes Henan and Shandong provinces. It is not clear yet, if the Tham clan was using the \"Tham\" clan name in Henan province.\n\nWithin Henan province, the Tham Tribal people probably originated in Hongnong/Wun Lun ( 弘 農), renamed during the Qing Dynasty ( 1644 - 1912 ) as Wun Yeong ( 弘 陽) sometime after the reign of Emperor Yao ( 堯 帝 ) (2337-2258 BC. Hongnong/Wun Lun is now known as Lingbao ( 靈 寶 市).[^1] Another source indicates the location to be more exactly - 40 miles south of Lingbao.[^2] My calculation indicates this place would be Lushi city ( 盧 氏 ) and in simplified Chinese characters ( 卢 氏 ).\n\nWithin Shandong province, Zhuan Xu ( 顓 頊 ), a nephew of Yi Zhi ( 乙 摯 ), the eldest son of Huangdi ( 黃 帝 ) , the Yellow Emperor, gave one of his sons the authority to rule the Jiechu tribe living in the present day location of Licheng ( 歷 城 ) , a few kilometers east of Jinan ( 濟 南 市 ) , present day capital, Shandong province. The Yellow Emperor ( surname of \"Ji\" ) is a legendary Chinese sovereign considered to be ancestor of all Han Chinese and reigned between 2698 - 2598 BC. \"Throughout the two Dynasties of Xia ( 夏 朝 ) (2205-1766 BC) and Shang ( 商 朝 ) (1783-122 BC) the descendants of Zhuan Xu lived there peacefully.\"\n\nIn 1122 BC, King Wu ( 周 武 王 ) destroyed the Shang Dynasty and founded the Zhou Dynasty ( 周 朝 ) ( 1134-256 BC). King Wu gave the ruler of Jiechu ( 杰 出), who had helped him, the authority to rule an area called Tan in the western part of the present day Zhangqiu county ( 章 丘 縣 ) , which was renamed the State of Tan ( 譚 國 ) . The States of Tan and Qi ( 齊 國 ) were adjacent States. In 684 BC, the ruler of Qi, Chiang Xiaobai ( 姜 小 白 ) , sent troops, conquered, and annexed the State of Tan. The ruler of Tan and his family fled to the State of Ju ( 莒 國), in present day Ju county ( 莒 縣) , Shandong. Members of the ruler of Tan adopted Tan as their surname in remembrance of their extinct State.\n\n### State of Tan ( 譚 國 )\n\nThe location of this fiefdom is approximately 35 km east of the present day capital of Shandong province, Jinan and just west of Zhangqiu City, Zhangqiu county, (formerly Licheng county) in a general area known as Longshan. This is the area where the first late Neolithic culture in China was excavated in 1931. The Longshan Culture (3000 – 2000 BC) is noted for its high skill level in pottery making (highly polished black pottery), using pottery wheels and where both stone to bronze tools were in use and it was also marked by the emergence of cities, as evidenced by rammed earth walls and moats. Rice cultivation enabled this establishment of cities. The center of the Longshan Culture was the Chengziya site (Town by the Cliff) along the banks of the Wuyuan River, the site of the State of Tan ( 譚 國 ) palace.\n\n### Tan Clan Migrations\n\nThe conquest of the State of Tan in 684 BC introduced the adoption of Tan as a surname and members of the Tan clan fled to the southeast to a neighboring State, the State of Ju ( 莒國 ). Other sources have also indicated that Hongnong, Henan province Hongnong, Henan Province ( 河南省弘農郡 ); was the Tan Hall Name of origin, is located 40 miles south of Lingbao, Henan province. This Hongnong is also considered the hometown of the Ba people who lived just south of present day Chongqing in a place named Banan. The Ba people, fierce fighters and known for their unusual practice of placing their coffins on the sides of inaccessible cliffs. It is known that there were 6 Tan families that lived among the Ba people that came either from Hongnong or directly from the State of Tan – after it was conquered.\n\n![Shandong map](/images/about/ShandongMap.jpg)\n\nIn Linyi prefecture, adjacent to Ju county, is the city of Tancheng ( 郯 城 ) and it claims to be the ancient capital of the State of Tan. The Chinese character ( 郯 ) is a surname and the name of an ancient city. The Tan character ( 談 ) is associated with a Lord Tan administered a walled city called Tan during the Spring and Autumn Period ( 722 BC - 481 BC ). Perhaps the ( 郯 ) character is a variation of the 談 character, consequently, Tancheng may be the capital of the State of Tan that was re-established during the Tang Dynasty ( 618 - 907 AD ). One source indicates that there is a record of a Tan Yau Wo, who had a title and was the ruler of a State of Tan. This needs historical verification and additional research into these two surnames and re-established State of Tan.\n\nUsing, 901 AD, the birth year of Tan Hong-zhi ( 譚 宏 帙 ), the first Tan in Guangdong province as a reference year - the approximately 1600 years between 684 BC and 901 AD was the period for the Tham clan migration from Shandong to Guangdong province. There is also information that suggests that the migration of the Tham clan had reached Henan province by the end of the Han Dynasty. There was a considerable concentration of the Tham clan inhabiting the Wang Yeung district of Henan province during the Han Dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ). Tan Hong-zhi had migrated from Jiangxi province to Guangdong province.\n\n## Origins of the Tan ( 譚 ) surname\n\n“Tan” is the Pinyin romanization used for the Chinese surname ( 譚 ).\n\nThe challenge is to organize the information on the origins of the Tan surname in a coherent explanation and to try to confirm this explanation from historical references and Tan family zupu(s).\n\nResearch reveals several surnames as sources for the Tan surname.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor ( Huang Di ) ( 黃 帝 ), also known as Xuan Yuan ( 軒 轅 ) reigned from 2698 – 2598 BC and is considered to be the ancestor of all Han Chinese. The surname of the Yellow Emperor was Ji ( 姬 ). The Cantonese romanization of Ji is “Gay or Kay”.\n\nIt is said that the Tan ( 譚 ) lineage came from the Yellow Emperor's descendants: his grandson, Zhuan Xu ( 顓 頊 ) in 2513 BC appointed one of his sons to be a ruler of a tribe called Jie Chu ( 杰 出) in an area located just east of present day Jinan, the capital of Shandong province. This area was renamed the settlement of Tan.\n\nThereafter, from Zhuan Xu’s grandson, Xia Yu ( 夏 禹 ), whose surname was changed to Si ( 姒 ). Xia Yu ( 夏 禹 ) had successfully tamed the Yellow River floods and came to be known as the Great Yu ( 大 禹 ). For this accomplishment, he was bestowed the surname Si ( 姒 ) by the Emperor Shun ( 帝 舜 ). HIs name was Si Wenming ( 姒 文 命 ). Yu ( 禹 ) was the founder of the Xia Dynasty ( 夏 朝 ) ( 2207 – 1766 BC ).\n\nXia Yu had a grandson called Bo Yi ( 伯 益 ) whose surname of Si ( 姒 ) was changed to Ying ( 贏 ) for his meritorious services. He had assisted King Wu, who destroyed the Shang Dynasty ( 1765 – 1122 BC ) and established the Zhou Dynasty ( 1121 – 222 BC ) in 1122 BC and bestowed on Bo Yi the title of Viscount. King Wu also upgraded the settlement of Tan to the State of Tan ( 譚 國 ).\n\nA second legend mentions that the Tan surname came from the Yellow Emperor's ( 黃帝 ) son Shaohao ( 少昊 ). From the time of Diku ( 帝嚳 ), Houji ( 后稷 ) and up to the beginning of the Zhou Dynasty ( 周 朝 ), the family surname was Ji ( 姬 ). At the beginning of the Zhou Dynasty, Wuwang ( 武 王 ) appointed Ji Xiao ( 姬 孝 ) to the fiefdom of Tan ( 譚 國 ) in Shandong Province ( 山 東 省 ) and he was bestowed the noble title of Hou ( 候 ) or duke ( 譚 公 ).\n\nIn 684 BC the State of Tan ( 譚 國 ) was destroyed by the more powerful neighboring State of Qi ( 齊 國 ). The Tan court fled to the State of Ju ( 莒國 ), and thereafter they adopted Tan ( 譚 ) as their surname in remembrance of their lost State. Another source indicates it was the remaining Tan court that adopted the Tan ( 譚 ) surname.\n\nSince legends are lost in the mists of time, there can be no certainty as to their veracity.\n\nBut according to the Shijing ( 詩 經 ), Chunqiu Zuozhuan ( 春 秋 左 傳 ), Gouliangzhuan ( 虢 梁 傳 ) and Gongyangzhuan ( 公 羊 傳 ), the earliest records mention a Viscount Tan ( 譚 子 ) who fled to the State of Ju ( 莒國 ) when the State of Qi ( 齊 國 ) destroyed the State of Tan ( 譚 國 ) in 684 BC. Most sources seem to confirm this. Being descendants of the Yellow Emperor, the ruling family of the settlement of Tan or the State of Tan ( 譚 國 ) were surnamed Ji ( 姬 ) which was also the surname of the rulers of the Zhou Dynasty. In essence they were all descendants from the Yellow Emperor and were thus related to each other. Since, it is also quite conceivable that surnames Ji ( 姬 ), Si ( 姒 ) or Ying ( 贏 ) could have been the preceding surnames of Tan surname ( 譚 氏 ).\n\nThere are large concentrations of the Tan Clan within the Siyi / Sze Yap ( four districts / counties ) 四 邑- which is comprised of:\n\n- Taishan (Toishan) 台 山\n- Kaiping (Hoiping) 開 平\n- Enping (Yanping) 恩 平\n- Xinhui (Sunwui) 新 會\n\nDuring the 3rd century, an area known as Pingyi was formed covering the area now known as Wuyi ( Xinhui, Taishan, Kaiping, Enping, and Heshan ). Later it became known as Xinhui (Sunwui) , then, as Kong Chow during the 6th and 7th centuries.\n\nEnping was established in the year 1478 and Xinning (Sunning) \"new tranquility\" was established in 1498 and was renamed Taishan in 1912. Kaiping (Hoiping) was established in 1649 from parts of Xinhui, Xinning and Enping counties. The overwhelming percentage of overseas Chinese in North America have Sze Yap origins.\n\nAn excellent resource on Chinese Surnames is The Origin of Chinese Surnames by CHUNG Yoon-Ngan, 2002, ISBN 1 876763 66 3.

At the end of the Song Dynasty, it has been estimated that about half the population, 50 million Han Chinese people, may have perished in total as a result of the Mongol invasion and conquest of China. This warfare and instability pushed many Han Chinese southward. During the late Ming ( 明 朝 ,1368 - 1644 AD ) Dynasty, Ming officials escaped from Kaifeng ( 開 封 ) city in central China to Zhujixiang ( 珠 璣 巷 ) to avoid war and persecution. Later they moved to different places in the Pearl River Delta and became ancestors of many Cantonese locals.\n\n![Migrations map](/images/about/MigrationsMap.jpg)\n\nOne Tham genealogy source indicates that there were members of the Tham clan living in Hunan ( 湖 南 ) province during the Han Dynasty ( 漢 朝 , 140 BC - 220 AD). Another genealogical source reveals that southern migrations Chinese came through the provinces of Jiangxi and Zhejiang. The reference to Jiangxi province is also confirmed by another Tham clan genealogy history which states: \" a scholar by the name of Hing Bon ( 興 邦 ) aka Yiu Sang ( 裔 生 ) lived in Sheung Tam Village ( 湘 潭 ­), Changsha City ( 長 沙 市 ) Hunan Province. In 1007 AD he moved to Jian City () in Jiangxi Province.\" [^1] Tham Fang Ett, a direct descendant of Hing Bon, emigrated from Jiangxi province to Guangdong province. The Sheung District, ( English translation did not provide the Chinese characters ) in Shaanxi ( 陝 西 )province has also identified as one of the places where the Tham Clan lived during the Han ( 漢 朝 ) Dynasty ( 206 BC - 220 AD ). During the fourth and fifth centuries, deteriorating political conditions in northern China provided the impetus for the continued southward migrations. Afterwards, the Mongol invasion of northern China during the 12 th century also initiated major migrations of Chinese southward.\n\nZhang Jiuling (678-740 AD), a prime minister of the Tang Dynasty. Zhang is regarded as the highest official among the Cantonese of all times, ever appointed in China by the central government.\n\nIn A.D. 716 Zhang Jiuling, pushed the government to construct a good road that pierced the mountain barrier connecting his home region in northern Guangdong to the Yangzi River basin in neighboring Jiangxi Province. This route to Guangdong greatly facilitated immigration and the introduction of Chinese culture and technology from the north. Consequently, northern Guangdong developed rapidly and soon overtook the West River basin to become the most densely populated region of the province. By the Song dynasty, this area became the springboard for rapid colonization of the Pearl River Delta region.[^3]\n\nMei Kuan Pass was also called Qinguan Pass in history, lying 30 km away from Nanxiong County Seat, which separates Guangdong from Jiangxi Province. Meiguan Pass had been an important postal road and a military fort for centuries, well known as \"the First Pass to South China\". Along the ancient postal road there grow a lot of plum trees. When the plum trees in blossom in winter, there appears an ocean of white clouds with fragrant odor spreading near and far. Hence Meiguan (Pass of Plum Trees). The ancient Meiguan Gateway still stands there, reminding of the past postal road from Central China to South China. ( from Jin Huikang, [Southcn.com](https://www.southcn.com/) )\n\nNanxiong ( Nam Hung ) ( 南 雄 ) became a major city in the northern portion of Guangdong province because of its geographic location with the border to Jiangxi province and the pass through the mountains. As Nanxiong grew, a village on its outskirts, Zhujixiang ( 珠 璣 巷 ) (Ju Gei Hong - \"Pearl Lane\"), was established by a group of migrants from a region in Zhejiang near the city of Shanghai.\n\nDuring the late Ming Dynasty officials escaped from Kaifeng, Henan province in Central China to Zhujixiang to avoid the war and persecution. Afterwards, they moved on to various places on the Pearl River Delta. The Meiguan postal road, which had become the artery of transportation linking South China to Central China and through which thousands of Han Chinese migrated to Lingnan Region in history, especially in the Song Dynasty.\n\nThe explanation for the movement of Chinese, including the Tham clan, from Nanxiong to the Taishan region is based upon one of the famous tales in Cantonese traditions with multiple versions â€“ the tale of Wu Fei ( 胡 妃 ).\n\nAround 1270 AD, an imperial concubine, Wu Fei, fell into disfavor. She fled secretly from the palace, met a merchant named Huang Zhuman ( 黃 貯 萬 ) and became his concubine in Nanxiong. The emperor could not find her. Disclosure of Wu Fei in Nanxiong, by a disgruntled servant of this merchant, alarmed a local government official who devised a story to conceal this scandal from the emperor. Because this happened under his jurisdiction, this official would be held accountable - so he advised the emperor that there was a need to build a fort to house a garrison of soldiers to protect the local citizens from bandits and with the building of this fort â€“ it displaced 97 families from Zhujixiang. The 97 heads of these households met, applied and received a transit pass to Xinhui. Another version says that the official asked for troops to wipe out bandits - in reality, the population Zhujixiang - to seal their lips forever. A third version says that troops were sent to slaughter the people of Zhujixiang because they hid Wu Fei and the fourth version says that troops were sent to escort Wu Fei back to the emperor. Regardless of the reason, the residents of Zhujixiang left and/or fled. They traveled by boat down the North River to Xiangshan and settled in the Pearl River Delta. The area, where there was a large concentration of the Tham clan in Xinhui, was renamed Hoiping (Kaiping), adjacent to Taishan, around 1650. This migration from Nanxiong to Xinhui accounts for approximately 100 clans that now have long established roots in the Pearl River Delta.\n\nIn reading the histories of other clan migrations, I am learning about the possible migration routes, timelines, and circumstances for members of the Tham clan, who may have been part of those migration episodes. If you know about migrations that could or did include the Tham clan, I would be very grateful for the information - thank you in advance.\n\n## Guangdong Province\n\nGeographically, Guangdong ( 廣 東 ), formerly known as Kwangtung or Canton province, is located on the south coast of China and separated from the north by a few mountain ranges collectively called the Southern Mountain Range. The combined watersheds of the West, North and East rivers and comprise what is known as the Lingnan ( 嶺 南 ) region, and these rivers drain into and form the Pearl River Delta. Guangdong topography is higher in the northeast and lower in the southwest. The eastern and northeastern parts are mountainous, the central region is hilly with bench terraces, and in the south - the Pearl River Delta is an alluvial plain.\n\nHistorically, Guangdong was far removed from the center of Chinese civilization in the north China plain. After China's first emperor, Qin ( 秦 ) Shi Huang, conquered the six rival kingdoms and united China ( 221 BC), he ordered the conquest of the region comprised of the present-day Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, and northern Vietnam, then known as Nanyue( 南 越 ) and established its capital of Panyu ( 番 禺 ) near Guangzhou, formerly known as Canton.\n\nNanyue, or southern Yue, was the name of the indigenous people of the region. By the Tang Dynasty, through intermarriage and cross-cultural interactions, the term Yue had largely became a regional designation rather than a cultural one. The conquest was completed by 214 BC and General Zhao Tuo ( 趙 佗 ) was appointed to command the garrison and he asked Qin Shi Huang to send 500,000 people from Central China to help settle the region. In was also in 214 BC that the Ling Canal, 70 km north of Guilin, was completed - which linked the Yangtze River, via the West River, with the Pearl River.\n\nThe dominance of Han Chinese in the Guangdong region resulted from several periods of mass migrations from the fall of the Han Dynasty onward. Specifically, the An Lushan Rebellion (755) resulted in a 75% increase in the population of Guangdong between 740s & 750s and 800s - 810s. The death toll of the An Lushan Rebellion, including suppression and famine, is estimated to be about 36 million people. The arrival of more migrants resulted in the local population was gradually assimilated into Han Chinese culture.\n\n\"It was customary for many centuries to send political offenders, and also some criminals, into exile in remote parts of the empire. Few of these ever returned to the north, and their descendants settled in the area to which the original exiles had been consigned. In the T'ang period the region of Canton was a favourite place for such exiles, and many Cantonese families trace their origin to seventh-century officials who were sent away to what was the a raw frontier province. The practice continued in the Sung period ( 960 -1278 ) but in Ming times Kwangtung and the far south were no longer considered fit places for exiles to go. They were henceforth sent to the newly-acquired south-western province of Yunnan.\" [^4]\n\n## Tham Origins in Guangdong province\n\nTan Hong-zhi ( 譚 宏 帙 ) was born in 901 AD and died in 974 AD and is acknowledged in various Tan clan genealogy books as the _first Tan to arrive in Guangdong province_. He had lived in Qianzhou [ current name: Ganzhou ( 贛 州 ) ], Jiangxi and to avoid social turmoil and moved to Shashui( 沙 水 ) Village, Nanxiong ( 南 雄 ), and subsequently returned to Qianzhou. Genealogy books for the Tan clan in Guangdong begin with Tan Hong-zhi as the first generation.\n\n![GuangDong](/images/about/Guangdong.jpg)\n\nThe Tan clan settled in four locations prior to the migration to the Pearl River Delta: Shixing (始 興 ), Conghua ( 從 化 ), Longmen ( 龍 門 ), and Renhua ( 仁化 ).\n\nThe group in Shixing began with General Tan Tian ( 談 瑱 ), of South & North Dynasty ( 南 北 朝 ) (479-581 AD). They resided in Shixing and nearby counties. The population was about 10,000. The genealogy of this group was compiled.\n\nThe group in Conghua ( 從 化 ) began with scholar Tan Heng ( 譚 恆 ) in Sung Dynasty (960 - 1279 AD.) They lived in Conghua area, and their population was small. Not much recorded about this group.\n\nThe group in Longmen ( 龍 門 ) began with scholar Tan Rui Qi ( 譚 銳 奇 ) who moved from Geyang ( 戈 陽 ), Jiangxi, Providence to Longmen, Guangdong Province. Their population was also small and has not written records.\n\nThe fourth group is the largest in Guangdong who resided in Renhua ( 仁化 ), Guangdong. The White Water (Bai-shui) ( 白水 ) Tham family is in this group. The Renhua group began with Tan Bak Tong ( 譚 伯 倉 ), the Minister of Department of Justice in Sung Dynasty. He was the grandson of Tham Fan Ett and was born in 988 AD and died in 1061 AD. He retired in Pengshanli, Renhua. This group compiled immaculate genealogical records, and each family of this group has kept up with their genealogical studies. The history of this branch of Tham family can be traced, by ancestor, as early as 901 AD.\n\nTham Bak Tong had eight sons. His sixth son, Tan Jale An ( 譚 朝 安 ), had the most descendants and became the _first Tan to settle in Taishan_ ( 台 山 ).\n\nStarting with Tan Hong-zhi, it was during the first 12th generation that Tan Hen Lin ( 譚 天 麟 ) became the _first Tan to settled in White Water ( 白水 ), Taishan_. He moved from a place near Shaoguan ( 韶 关 ), just south of Renhua. Tan Hen Lin lived in a village named \"Old Village\" ( 舊 村 ), just outside the northwestern part of Taicheng ( 台 山 市 ) an area now known as \"5 horse returning to the trough\" ( 五 馬 歸 槽 ) . In all the Tham genealogy books I have seen, Tan Hen Lin as the 12th generation is now used as the first generation of the Tan clan in Taishan - one genealogy book has both the generational orders running in parallel, i.e., the 12th generation has a 1st generation beside it and so on.\n\n## Henry Tom's comments on the Origins and History of the Tom (Tham) Clan:\n\n> Generally, so far - much of the information supports the view of the State of Tan origins in Shandong, however, perhaps it can be reconciled with the four brothers view of the Tom origins.\n>\n> As you might have noticed, I have not listed my sources in the traditional academic format would make this general overview difficult to read. For now, I just wanted to convey a general sense for the origins and history of the Tom Clan. As, additional translations are completed and other English sources become available- I will begin to document and cite all the facts appropriately. Please forgive me until then.\n>\n> If you have additional information that you would like to share - I will be more than happy to acknowledge you and your sources.\n>\n> In essence, I see the origins and history of the Tom Clan in the following segments:\n>\n> 1.  Origins, history and migrations within Shandong province.\n> 2.  History of Tom Clan migrations out of Shandong - relationship to the Hakka migrations\n> 3.  Origins, history, and migration within Guangdong province.\n> 4.  History of the Tom Clan, as part of the overall overseas Chinese migrations, out of China to various countries.\n\n## The Tham clan in Malaysia\n\nIn Malaysia, tin mining was operated by Chinese from the late 18th century and became a Chinese monopoly, attracting migrants from the Sam Yap and Sze Yap counties of Guangdong province. Perhaps, because of this historic experience, many Chinese from the Pearl River Delta region were accustomed to mining overseas in America and Australia. With the California gold rush in the mid 19 th century, America became known as Gold Mountain (Gim-san ), while afterwards, around the city of Melbourne – Australia became known as the New Gold Mountain ( Hsin Gim-san). Chinese miners were highly independent and Chinese mining communities were well armed and led by courageous men of enterprise.\n\n---\n\n[^1]: Raymond Tom, et al, \"10000 miles & 100 years Journey from JIshi village to Gold Mountain 萬里世紀之旅\"\n\n[^2]: http://yutopian.net/names/19/19Tan262.html\n\n[^3]: Him Mark Lai, Becoming Chinese American: A History of Communities and Institutions, Alta Mira Press, 2004, ISBN 0-7591-0458-1\n\n[^4]: C.

This scattered information, however, needs to be systematically compiled, integrated, and translated from these Chinese sources into an authoritative treatise. Beyond the difficulties associated with Chinese-English translations, historical discrepancies also require adjudication and explanation. These notes on the Tham clan should be considered as a composite of English translations of some of the Chinese sources. As initial notes, there is, hopefully, a recognition and acceptance that they are imperfect, provisional, and a work in progress that is frequently updated. Currenly, the intent is just to provide an general overview and coherent understanding of the origins and history of the Tham clan.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In general, there seem to be two prevailing views on the origins and history of the Tham clan.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"tom-tham-origins-from-four-brothers\">Tom (Tham) Origins from Four Brothers\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The first view is the basis for the Chew Lun Association ( 昭 倫 公 所 ) This is a four clan association that includes the four surnames—Hom (譚 ), Tom ( 談 ), Huey ( 許 ), Der ( 謝 ). The characters for all the surnames used the radical yan 言 on the left. These surnames were all alleged to be derived from a descendant of Chiang Tai Kung ( 姜 太 公 ) (1210-1120BC), one of the most celebrated generals in Chinese history and worshipped even today in China as a god who protects homes and shops. This descendant, Wei, was the father of four sons. As they were living in the times of political strife, Wei was afraid to bequeath his clan name to his progeny. He therefore only gave them first names, which were Hom, Tom, Huey and Der. When these sons grew up the father cautioned them about revealing their real clan name, but always come to the aid of each other. Later, these sons took their first names as family names, but always remembered their father’s injunction to help each other. The Chew Lun four-family alliance came about many centuries later to reunite the descendants of the sons of Wei, who started out as blood brothers. The Tom, Hom, Huey and Tse clans are found throughout the world and there are also Chew Lun Association branches in many cities and countries. This was initially described under Clan Associations under Genealogy.

The Yellow Emperor ( surname of “Ji” ) is a legendary Chinese sovereign considered to be ancestor of all Han Chinese and reigned between 2698 - 2598 BC. “Throughout the two Dynasties of Xia ( 夏 朝 ) (2205-1766 BC) and Shang ( 商 朝 ) (1783-122 BC) the descendants of Zhuan Xu lived there peacefully.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 1122 BC, King Wu ( 周 武 王 ) destroyed the Shang Dynasty and founded the Zhou Dynasty ( 周 朝 ) ( 1134-256 BC).

The States of Tan and Qi ( 齊 國 ) were adjacent States. In 684 BC, the ruler of Qi, Chiang Xiaobai ( 姜 小 白 ) , sent troops, conquered, and annexed the State of Tan. The ruler of Tan and his family fled to the State of Ju ( 莒 國), in present day Ju county ( 莒 縣) , Shandong.

The Longshan Culture (3000 – 2000 BC) is noted for its high skill level in pottery making (highly polished black pottery), using pottery wheels and where both stone to bronze tools were in use and it was also marked by the emergence of cities, as evidenced by rammed earth walls and moats. Rice cultivation enabled this establishment of cities.

King Wu also upgraded the settlement of Tan to the State of Tan ( 譚 國 ).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A second legend mentions that the Tan surname came from the Yellow Emperor’s ( 黃帝 ) son Shaohao ( 少昊 ). From the time of Diku ( 帝嚳 ), Houji ( 后稷 ) and up to the beginning of the Zhou Dynasty ( 周 朝 ), the family surname was Ji ( 姬 ). At the beginning of the Zhou Dynasty, Wuwang ( 武 王 ) appointed Ji Xiao ( 姬 孝 ) to the fiefdom of Tan ( 譚 國 ) in Shandong Province ( 山 東 省 ) and he was bestowed the noble title of Hou ( 候 ) or duke ( 譚 公 ).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 684 BC the State of Tan ( 譚 國 ) was destroyed by the more powerful neighboring State of Qi ( 齊 國 ). The Tan court fled to the State of Ju ( 莒國 ), and thereafter they adopted Tan ( 譚 ) as their surname in remembrance of their lost State. Another source indicates it was the remaining Tan court that adopted the Tan ( 譚 ) surname.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since legends are lost in the mists of time, there can be no certainty as to their veracity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But according to the Shijing ( 詩 經 ), Chunqiu Zuozhuan ( 春 秋 左 傳 ), Gouliangzhuan ( 虢 梁 傳 ) and Gongyangzhuan ( 公 羊 傳 ), the earliest records mention a Viscount Tan ( 譚 子 ) who fled to the State of Ju ( 莒國 ) when the State of Qi ( 齊 國 ) destroyed the State of Tan ( 譚 國 ) in 684 BC. Most sources seem to confirm this. Being descendants of the Yellow Emperor, the ruling family of the settlement of Tan or the State of Tan ( 譚 國 ) were surnamed Ji ( 姬 ) which was also the surname of the rulers of the Zhou Dynasty. In essence they were all descendants from the Yellow Emperor and were thus related to each other. Since, it is also quite conceivable that surnames Ji ( 姬 ), Si ( 姒 ) or Ying ( 贏 ) could have been the preceding surnames of Tan surname ( 譚 氏 ).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There are large concentrations of the Tan Clan within the Siyi / Sze Yap ( four districts / counties ) 四 邑- which is comprised of:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Taishan (Toishan) 台 山\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Kaiping (Hoiping) 開 平\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Enping (Yanping) 恩 平\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Xinhui (Sunwui) 新 會\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>During the 3rd century, an area known as Pingyi was formed covering the area now known as Wuyi ( Xinhui, Taishan, Kaiping, Enping, and Heshan ).

At the end of the Song Dynasty, it has been estimated that about half the population, 50 million Han Chinese people, may have perished in total as a result of the Mongol invasion and conquest of China. This warfare and instability pushed many Han Chinese southward. During the late Ming ( 明 朝 ,1368 - 1644 AD ) Dynasty, Ming officials escaped from Kaifeng ( 開 封 ) city in central China to Zhujixiang ( 珠 璣 巷 ) to avoid war and persecution.

Consequently, northern Guangdong developed rapidly and soon overtook the West River basin to become the most densely populated region of the province.

Meiguan Pass had been an important postal road and a military fort for centuries, well known as “the First Pass to South China”. Along the ancient postal road there grow a lot of plum trees. When the plum trees in blossom in winter, there appears an ocean of white clouds with fragrant odor spreading near and far. Hence Meiguan (Pass of Plum Trees). The ancient Meiguan Gateway still stands there, reminding of the past postal road from Central China to South China.

As Nanxiong grew, a village on its outskirts, Zhujixiang ( 珠 璣 巷 ) (Ju Gei Hong - “Pearl Lane”), was established by a group of migrants from a region in Zhejiang near the city of Shanghai.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>During the late Ming Dynasty officials escaped from Kaifeng, Henan province in Central China to Zhujixiang to avoid the war and persecution. Afterwards, they moved on to various places on the Pearl River Delta. The Meiguan postal road, which had become the artery of transportation linking South China to Central China and through which thousands of Han Chinese migrated to Lingnan Region in history, especially in the Song Dynasty.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The explanation for the movement of Chinese, including the Tham clan, from Nanxiong to the Taishan region is based upon one of the famous tales in Cantonese traditions with multiple versions â€“ the tale of Wu Fei ( 胡 妃 ).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Around 1270 AD, an imperial concubine, Wu Fei, fell into disfavor. She fled secretly from the palace, met a merchant named Huang Zhuman ( 黃 貯 萬 ) and became his concubine in Nanxiong. The emperor could not find her. Disclosure of Wu Fei in Nanxiong, by a disgruntled servant of this merchant, alarmed a local government official who devised a story to conceal this scandal from the emperor. Because this happened under his jurisdiction, this official would be held accountable - so he advised the emperor that there was a need to build a fort to house a garrison of soldiers to protect the local citizens from bandits and with the building of this fort â€“ it displaced 97 families from Zhujixiang. The 97 heads of these households met, applied and received a transit pass to Xinhui. Another version says that the official asked for troops to wipe out bandits - in reality, the population Zhujixiang - to seal their lips forever. A third version says that troops were sent to slaughter the people of Zhujixiang because they hid Wu Fei and the fourth version says that troops were sent to escort Wu Fei back to the emperor. Regardless of the reason, the residents of Zhujixiang left and/or fled. They traveled by boat down the North River to Xiangshan and settled in the Pearl River Delta. The area, where there was a large concentration of the Tham clan in Xinhui, was renamed Hoiping (Kaiping), adjacent to Taishan, around 1650. This migration from Nanxiong to Xinhui accounts for approximately 100 clans that now have long established roots in the Pearl River Delta.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In reading the histories of other clan migrations, I am learning about the possible migration routes, timelines, and circumstances for members of the Tham clan, who may have been part of those migration episodes.

The combined watersheds of the West, North and East rivers and comprise what is known as the Lingnan ( 嶺 南 ) region, and these rivers drain into and form the Pearl River Delta. Guangdong topography is higher in the northeast and lower in the southwest. The eastern and northeastern parts are mountainous, the central region is hilly with bench terraces, and in the south - the Pearl River Delta is an alluvial plain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Historically, Guangdong was far removed from the center of Chinese civilization in the north China plain. After China’s first emperor, Qin ( 秦 ) Shi Huang, conquered the six rival kingdoms and united China ( 221 BC), he ordered the conquest of the region comprised of the present-day Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, and northern Vietnam, then known as Nanyue( 南 越 ) and established its capital of Panyu ( 番 禺 ) near Guangzhou, formerly known as Canton.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Nanyue, or southern Yue, was the name of the indigenous people of the region. By the Tang Dynasty, through intermarriage and cross-cultural interactions, the term Yue had largely became a regional designation rather than a cultural one. The conquest was completed by 214 BC and General Zhao Tuo ( 趙 佗 ) was appointed to command the garrison and he asked Qin Shi Huang to send 500,000 people from Central China to help settle the region. In was also in 214 BC that the Ling Canal, 70 km north of Guilin, was completed - which linked the Yangtze River, via the West River, with the Pearl River.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The dominance of Han Chinese in the Guangdong region resulted from several periods of mass migrations from the fall of the Han Dynasty onward. Specifically, the An Lushan Rebellion (755) resulted in a 75% increase in the population of Guangdong between 740s &#x26; 750s and 800s - 810s. The death toll of the An Lushan Rebellion, including suppression and famine, is estimated to be about 36 million people. The arrival of more migrants resulted in the local population was gradually assimilated into Han Chinese culture.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“It was customary for many centuries to send political offenders, and also some criminals, into exile in remote parts of the empire. Few of these ever returned to the north, and their descendants settled in the area to which the original exiles had been consigned. In the T’ang period the region of Canton was a favourite place for such exiles, and many Cantonese families trace their origin to seventh-century officials who were sent away to what was the a raw frontier province. The practice continued in the Sung period ( 960 -1278 ) but in Ming times Kwangtung and the far south were no longer considered fit places for exiles to go. They were henceforth sent to the newly-acquired south-western province of Yunnan.” \u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fn-4\" id=\"user-content-fnref-4\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">4\u003C/a>\u003C/sup>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"tham-origins-in-guangdong-province\">Tham Origins in Guangdong province\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Tan Hong-zhi ( 譚 宏 帙 ) was born in 901 AD and died in 974 AD and is acknowledged in various Tan clan genealogy books as the \u003Cem>first Tan to arrive in Guangdong province\u003C/em>.

With the California gold rush in the mid 19 th century, America became known as Gold Mountain (Gim-san ), while afterwards, around the city of Melbourne – Australia became known as the New Gold Mountain ( Hsin Gim-san).

Also, I mainly use it to commute to road, and the race geometry and components make it a fairly harsh ride over the roadworks around the city.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I strongly considered getting a Trek Project One custom build, but in the end I managed to get a good deal on the 2017 top of the range Specialised women’s bike; The Ruby Expert Ultegra Di2.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The bike description is on the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.specialized.com/au/en/ruby-expert-ultegra-di2/p/115588?color=214379-115588\">Specialized site\u003C/a> but here is a summary of the specs: it’s basically a comfort/endurance frame with front and rear suspension, Ultegra Di2 and disc brakes.

Sadly, I don&#8217;t believe the restaurant is still there but if anyone knows otherwise please let me know.\n\nMy recipe is a simple ones based on a combination of various recipes I have found on the Internet.\n\n## Recipe for Malaysian Kon Loh Mee\n\n### Equipment\n\n- Pot\n- Saucepan\n- Stove\n\n### Ingredients\n\nSauce:\n\n- 1 tablespoon soy sauce\n- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce (can subsitute with vegetarian oyster sauce)\n- 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce (kechap manis)\n- 1 teaspoon Vietnamese fish sauce (nuoc mam)\n- 1 teaspoon sesame oil\n\nOther:\n\n- 125-150 g egg noodles (you can typically buy this fresh from Asian supermarkets, the one I tend to use is called “Ever Green” from a company called “Unigreen” which I buy from Miracle Supermarket)\n- cooking oil (any type will do – I use sunflower oil)\n- 1 stalk broccoli leaves (or similar, I use broccolini for an elevated presentation)\n- 1 pot water (boiling)\n\n### Instructions\n\n1. Mix soy, kechap manis, fish sauce, oyster sauce and sesame oil in a bowl.\n2. Remove outer skin of shallot and cut and slice finely into rings (around 1-2mm thickness).\n3. Start heating shallots in a saucepan with a bit of oil (just enough to slightly coat the shallots).\n4. Boil water in a pot and poach broccoli leaves or broccolini for a few minutes until soft (usually no more than 2 minutes – I prefer mine slightly al dente). Take out and drain. Cut into 10cm stalks or leave uncut if you want a more rustic look.\n5. Put the noodles in the leftover boiling water and continue heating the water until it starts boiling again. Don’t overcook the noodles – generally no longer than 2-3 minutes or even shorter if you like it al dente like me.\n6. As noodle boils, the shallots should be browning. Remove browned shallots and put aside in a small dish.\n7. Once noodle is boiled, remove and drain and then rinse using cold water. This makes the noodles “springy.”\n8. In the saucepan where the shallots have been browned, leave the oil residue on the pan and pour the sauce mix into the pan. The sauce will heat up really quickly and start sizzling.\n9. When the sauce is sizzling, pour the rinsed noodles into the saucepan and start mixing until the noodles have warmed up again.\n10. Take out the stirred noodles and serve with broccoli leave/broccolini in a place.\n11. Add your favourite topping (char siu or BBQ pork, wantan, or whatever). I’ve even tried putting pork floss on top.\n12. Put the browned fried shallots on top as a garnish.\n\n## Examples","src/content/blog/2020/2020-10-01-kon-loh-mee-recipe.md",[1950],"../../../images/gallery/2020-10-01-kon-loh-mee-recipe/Kon-Loh-Mee-with-char-siu.jpg","3c482d898ef20c9a",{"html":1953,"metadata":1954},"\u003Cp>“Kon Loh Mee” or dry stirred noodles, is a popular Malaysian hawker dish, typically served with a combination of BBQ pork (“char siu”) and wantan, although variations exist such as minced meat (like an Asian version of spaghetti bolognese), roasted/steamed chicken and vegetarian options.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The noodles are usually thin egg noodles and the sauce tends to be thick, dark, slightly sweet.

Well, finally decided to cook a batch in 2023. This dish takes a long time to prepare but only seconds to cook, so everything has to be ready before the gas is lighted up.\n\nSome tips:\n\n1. The little things matter. Separate the rice noodles into individual strands, and remove tails from bean sprouts.\n2. Use the best ingredients. I used king prawns and premium lap cheong.\n3. I also sprinkled the prawns with a bit of cornflour and salt to make them slightly crispy. I like them this way.\n4. Ideally should use rendered pork lard to cook plus the \"pork croutons\" (chee yaw char) which are basically deep fried pork fat. I substituted with pork crackling bought from a Thai shop which I find acceptable (actually, I prefer them). If you want a halal version, you can eliminate this and the lap cheong.\n5. Do not overpower the wok, even if you have a commercial gas burner. Cook in small batches, and use way less noodles than you think you need. That way, you are guaranteed to get wok hei.\n6. Turn it up to 11. Use max heat for the entire cooking process. Do not be tempted to reduce the gas.\n\n## Recipe for Char Kuay Teow\n\n### Equipment\n\n- Cast iron wok and stirrer\n- Gas cooker\n\n### Ingredients\n\nI used a pre made sauce called\n[Bang Bang Char Kuay Teow sauce](https://www.hengleesauce.com/showproducts/productid/3934979/bang-bang-char-koay-teow-sauce/)\nbut it is also possible to make your own.\n\nSauce (balance to taste):\n\n- dark soy sauce\n- light soy sauce\n- oyster sauce\n- kecap manis (or use sugar)\n\nMain dish:\n\n- Flat rice noodles - a handful per serve\n- Chinese sausage (lap cheong) - 1 per serve, sliced\n- Fish cake - about 4-5 thin slices per serve\n- Fresh prawns, deshelled and cleaned - about 2-3 per serve\n- garlic - about 1-2 cloves, cut into tiny pieces\n- cooking oil - use your judgement, perhaps a few tablespoons\n- chilli paste or sambal belachan - 1 tablespoon or according to taste\n- pork \"croutons\" (chee yau char) - essentially deep fried tiny pork fat (I substituted with deep fried crispy pork crackling)\n- fresh bean sprouts, with tails removed - about a handful\n- garlic chives, cut into 1 inch pieces - about a handful\n\n### Instructions\n\n1. Heat wok on gas cooker.\n2. Add frying oil.\n3. When oil is hot, add garlic, prawns, lap cheong, fish cake together more or less at the same time.\n4. When above is sufficiently cooked (slightly brown), typically only a few seconds, add noodles.\n5. Wait for noodles to get slightly brown, then add chilli paste.\n6. Create space at centre of wok by moving ingredients around wok. Break an egg and toss contents into centre \"hole\". If required, add extra oil.\n7. Break the yolk and stir egg slightly - no need to batter or mix well. You don't want scrambled egg.\n8. Before egg has hardened, fold the noodles and other ingredients on top of egg, and stir a few times to blend the egg with the other ingredients.\n9. Avoid over stirring or blending - this breaks the noodles too much and the dish is meant to look rustic.\n10. When the dish looks ready (use your judgement based on what you have eaten that you enjoyed) add sauce, stir a few times until sauce is blended in.\n11. Turn off heat, add bean sprouts and chives. The remaining heat will gradually cook these ingredients.\n12. Before the bean sprouts and chives have cooked completely, remove from wok and plate up.\n\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02PfRnHe19jjYXtYiQVMS31LkdHiiYyuy4PxKxjSgVgw2NAbSiY7Y2TgiewaBccRCMl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"781\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\">\u003C/iframe>","src/content/blog/2023/2023-01-09-char-kuay-teow.md",[4005],"../../../images/food/Char Kuay Teow.jpeg","2c906dedaf56c7cc",{"html":4008,"metadata":4009},"\u003Cp>I bought my portable gas cooker and wok set last year, intending to cook the famous Malaysian dish Char Kuay Teow on it, but for various reasons never really got around to it.

We were going to catch the train, but were extremely late, so in a fit of madness jumped into the car. My parking angel was working overtime, because all the lights were green and we had a clear run to the opera house from Chatswood in 15 minutes (without even speeding)! Plus managed to not only find parking 15 minutes before the opera commenced, but somehow managed to get free parking. Thank you my angel - much appreciated.\n\nLa Boheme is of course my favourite opera, and we have experienced multiple productions over the last 40 years, and I own at least half a dozen recordings including the well known ones like the Decca 1959 Serafin version with Renata Tebaldi, the Karajan 1970s recording with Pavarotti/Freni and various others including the Beecham and the one featuring Andrea Bocelli.\n\nHere's a mini review. I also rewatched the\n[Handa production](https://iview.abc.net.au/show/opera-on-sydney-harbour-la-boheme)\nfrom 2019, which is still available on ABC iView.\n\nFirst of all, the positives. The opera is staged in the newly refurbished Joan Sutherland Theatre (formerly the Concert Hall) at the Sydney Opera House. The acoustics are vastly improved using acoustic treatments on the walls and ceilings (the previous Concert Hall was notorious for muddy, boomy sound due to the unique architecture).\n\nThe sets are quite impressive, and quite true to the original setting of the opera (Paris in the 1830s). Definitely better than the rather spartan nature of Baz Luhrmann's famous production in the 1990s, but less big budget and showy compared to the Handa production. All in all I thought they have captured the pre-Haussman Paris (that we all know today) and gave us a reasonable facsimile of Paris during the July Monarchy undergoing industrialisation. The sets referenced the rapid expansion of the outskirts of Paris and the re-fortification of the military wall quite well (Act 3), and Act 2 has a good recreation of the interior of Cafe Momus, although I thought the intrusion of Parpignol into the scene was not well handled. Act 1 and 4, meant to represent the interior of the bohemian's garret, are functional but a bit threadbare. I particularly liked the completed version of Marcello's Red Sea in Act IV which very few productions try to include.\nIncidentally I am super impressed by the Handa production inclusion of the furniture removal scene at the beginning of Act 4, which references the \"missing act\" discovered in 1957 (sorry, but I am a nerd and I like oblique references).\n\nNow, onto the singing and acting. I felt Act 1 was handled reasonably well, but a bit flat. Act 2 had a lot of energy and I think the performers rather enjoyed this act.\n\nActs 3 and 4 are where I feel the performance becomes disappointing. Puccini does an incredible balancing act between comedy and pathos and I think ultimately this is not handled well. Act 3 is meant to be an almost continuous tearjerker, but I didn't cry. The contrast between Rodolfo/Mimi and Marcello/Musetta in the quartet was reasonably well handled (and I particularly liked that Musetta and Marcello made up in the end) but the pacing is wrong and I am not wallowing in the poignancy of Roldolfo and Mimi's pre emptive farewell.\n\nAct 4 is where I am most disappointed. It is missing the first few lines of the libretto. The orchestral preludes segues into Rodolfo and Marcello reminiscing about their ex lovers, and skips the introductory remarks. I don't understand why these lines were skipped. The horseplay between the bohemians feel forced and unnatural, and when Musetta breaks in with the bad news we don't feel the jarring shock that we normally do. Mimi's final aria (Sono andati), surely one of the most moving pieces of music ever written, just feels perfunctory, and Rodolfo just does not cry his heart out enough in the final scene (I want them tears and sobs dammit). Lyn Cheah feels it was rushed through - I am not sure but the pacing is definitely off and I didn't leave the performance emotionally drained but satisfied like I normally do.\n\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02GwSQHuqxXiXtQs3yoKEmM3fHJgr95g9aotaFPw2VMCYLrXtHR4FmywFbcLbp99GNl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"614\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\">\u003C/iframe>","src/content/blog/2023/2023-01-14-la-boheme.md",[4160],"../../../images/gallery/2023-01-14-la-boheme/DSC01525.jpeg","9f48427bca1370f2",{"html":4163,"metadata":4164},"\u003Cp>Our friend Patricia had 2 tickets to La Boheme and since it is our favourite\nopera, we decided to go.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Getting there turned out to be quite eventful.

The sets referenced the rapid expansion of the outskirts of Paris and the re-fortification of the military wall quite well (Act 3), and Act 2 has a good recreation of the interior of Cafe Momus, although I thought the intrusion of Parpignol into the scene was not well handled. Act 1 and 4, meant to represent the interior of the bohemian’s garret, are functional but a bit threadbare. I particularly liked the completed version of Marcello’s Red Sea in Act IV which very few productions try to include.\nIncidentally I am super impressed by the Handa production inclusion of the furniture removal scene at the beginning of Act 4, which references the “missing act” discovered in 1957 (sorry, but I am a nerd and I like oblique references).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now, onto the singing and acting. I felt Act 1 was handled reasonably well, but a bit flat. Act 2 had a lot of energy and I think the performers rather enjoyed this act.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Acts 3 and 4 are where I feel the performance becomes disappointing. Puccini does an incredible balancing act between comedy and pathos and I think ultimately this is not handled well. Act 3 is meant to be an almost continuous tearjerker, but I didn’t cry. The contrast between Rodolfo/Mimi and Marcello/Musetta in the quartet was reasonably well handled (and I particularly liked that Musetta and Marcello made up in the end) but the pacing is wrong and I am not wallowing in the poignancy of Roldolfo and Mimi’s pre emptive farewell.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Act 4 is where I am most disappointed. It is missing the first few lines of the libretto. The orchestral preludes segues into Rodolfo and Marcello reminiscing about their ex lovers, and skips the introductory remarks. I don’t understand why these lines were skipped. The horseplay between the bohemians feel forced and unnatural, and when Musetta breaks in with the bad news we don’t feel the jarring shock that we normally do. Mimi’s final aria (Sono andati), surely one of the most moving pieces of music ever written, just feels perfunctory, and Rodolfo just does not cry his heart out enough in the final scene (I want them tears and sobs dammit). Lyn Cheah feels it was rushed through - I am not sure but the pacing is definitely off and I didn’t leave the performance emotionally drained but satisfied like I normally do.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02GwSQHuqxXiXtQs3yoKEmM3fHJgr95g9aotaFPw2VMCYLrXtHR4FmywFbcLbp99GNl&#x26;show_text=true&#x26;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"614\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\">\u003C/iframe>",{"headings":4165,"imagePaths":4166,"frontmatter":4167},[],[],{"title":4146,"pubDate":4168,"description":4147,"coverImage":4160,"gallery":4153,"categories":4169,"tags":4170,"minutesRead":2026,"extra":4171},["Date","2023-01-14T12:00:00.000Z"],[616,638],[4146,4155,4156],[],"2023/2023-01-16-gotong-royong",{"id":4172,"data":4174,"body":4186,"filePath":4187,"assetImports":4188,"digest":4190,"rendered":4191},{"title":4175,"description":4176,"pubDate":4177,"categories":4178,"images":4180,"tags":4182},"Gotong Royong for Lunar New Year 2023","2nd year of making bakkwa and kuih kapit",["Date","2023-01-16T11:00:00.000Z"],[4179],{"id":572,"collection":440},[4181],"__ASTRO_IMAGE_../../../images/food/Gotong Royong 2023.jpg",[4183,2408,4184,4185],"gotong royong","bakkwa","kuih kapit","Last year the Gotong Royong Girls embarked on our first project - making bakkwa (also called loong yoke in Cantonese) and kuih kapit (love letters) for Lunar New Year.

Verdict: surprisingly tasty.\n\n## Recipe for Char Kuay Teow\n\n### Equipment\n\n- Cast iron wok and stirrer\n- Gas cooker\n\n### Ingredients\n\nI used a pre made sauce called\n[Bang Bang Char Kuay Teow sauce](https://www.hengleesauce.com/showproducts/productid/3934979/bang-bang-char-koay-teow-sauce/)\nbut it is also possible to make your own.\n\nSauce (balance to taste):\n\n- dark soy sauce\n- light soy sauce\n- oyster sauce\n- kecap manis (or use sugar)\n\nMain dish:\n\n- Cooked rice, cooled - 1 cup\n- Chinese sausage (lap cheong) - 2 per serve, sliced\n- Fish cake - about 10 thin slices per serve (half a packet)\n- Dried prawns, soaked in warm water and then cut into tiny pieces\n- garlic - about 1-2 cloves, cut into tiny pieces\n- cooking oil - use your judgement, perhaps a few tablespoons\n- chilli paste or sambal belachan - 1 tablespoon or according to taste\n- iceberg lettuce\n\n### Instructions\n\n1. Heat wok on gas cooker.\n2. Add frying oil.\n3. When oil is hot, add garlic, dried prawns, lap cheong, fish cake together more or less at the same time.\n4. Wait for ingredients to be sufficiently cooked (slightly brown), typically after a minute or two. Toss a few times.\n5. Create space at centre of wok by moving ingredients around wok. Break two eggs and toss contents into centre \"hole\". If required, add extra oil.\n6. Break the yolks and stir eggs slightly - no need to batter or mix well. You don't want scrambled egg.\n7. Add salt and pepper to egg.\n8. Before egg has hardened, fold the other ingredients on top of egg, and stir a few times to blend the egg with the other ingredients.\n9. Add chilli paste (and extra oil if necessary). Wait till paste softens and breaks, then stir in other ingredients.\n10. Add rice. Stir a few times until rice breaks into individual grains.\n11. When the dish looks ready (use your judgement based on what you have eaten that you enjoyed) add CKT sauce, stir a few times until sauce is blended in rice.\n12. Turn off heat, add lettuce. The remaining heat will slightly soften the lettuce.\n13.

An original 1973 UK pressing of La Boheme conducted by Karajan with the Berlin Philharmonic and featuring Pavarotti and Freni in their prime.\n\nGramophone magazine hailed this as the greatest La Boheme recording ever made. I wont disagree, even though I have a soft spot for the 1959 Serafin recording with Tebaldi. In any case, I have been searching for this LP set for most of my life.\n\nIt is in good condition, and comes with the libretto. Even better, it is quite moldy - which is a good sign for record collectors. Mold means nobody has played the record in years, and often the LPs will sound excellent after cleaning.\n\nSure enough, I was very happy after playing back Sides 3 and 4 (corresponding to Acts 3 and 4).\n\nAlthough I am generally not a fan of Karajan for Italian operas (I find him a bit too ponderous and not \"Italian\" enough), he is perfect for Acts 3 and 4 and the interpretation and performance simply cannot be faulted.\n\nHe is in absolute control of the orchestra and Germanic precision wins over Italian passion as every note sounds perfectly crafted, and yet totally in place and in context with the other notes.\n\nKarajan is smart and humble enough to work in sympathy with the singers and the orchestra is never in competition with them. He gives space to allow the singers to express themselves fully, and never have I heard more dynamic range in the vocals than in this recording.\n\nThis recording is proof of John Culshaw's thesis that sometimes it is better to listen to an opera recording rather than experiencing it live on stage. Made in the heyday of operatic studio recordings, this was specially commissioned by Decca and recorded with beautiful acoustics at the Jesus Christus Kirche in Berlin.\nBecause the singers know it is a studio recording and the mics will capture every breath faithfully, they are brave enough to vary their dynamic range all the way down to a whisper, and hearing this on an LP is a revelation compared to the muddy and indistinct CD.\n\nPavarotti in particular demonstrates just why he was regarded as the world's greatest tenor. He manages to evoke emotion in every note - you know exactly how he is feeling without requiring an understanding of Italian. His voice is perfect, beautifully crafted and absolutely sublime.\n\nFreni was in her prime and amply demonstrates why she is famous for her Mimi, and she is such a professional she takes the trouble to evoke some very realistic TB sounding coughs whilst maintaining a sweet singing voice.\n\nAct 3 is wonderful demonstration of how restrained the singers and the orchestra are. Rather than projecting and belting out the lines, the singers evoke such tenderness and regret. The moment that Rodolfo changes from criticising Mimi to admitting he is terrified she is gravely ill and likely to die soon, then realising Mimi is nearby and overheard every word - that part always sends me to tears. The quartet, where Puccini delicately balances between comedy and pathos, jealousy and love, loss and forgiveness, recrimination and hope - always strike me with a sense of wonder how Puccini can juggle all these emotions at once - is perfectly rendered and not overpowering.\n\nAct 4 has to be the most perfect performance ever. The orchestra knows just when to be loud and when to be almost whisper quiet. The timing of singers are impeccable and one can imagine every scene perfectly, with even the swordplay sounding scintillating across the soundstage.\n\nSome critics have complained that Puccini's inclusion of Colline's ode to his coat is disruptive and badly timed, and simply an excuse for a baritone aria. I disagree, Puccini has always been a genius, and he took us to the brink of pathos with the arrival of Musetta, so Colline's aria takes us back from the edge and give us a bit of breathing space before the final assault on the emotions.\n\nKarajan and Ghiaurov implicitly understand this and Colline saying goodbye to his coat is sung in even, calming tones with the orchestra providing a rhythmic and measured accompaniment, rather than for comical effect.\n\nWhen Schaunard and Colline leave, the orchestra picks up just enough for a brief and enchanting prelude before Mimi sings \"Sono andati\" At this point I am usually crying like a baby.\n\nKarajan and the singers demonstrate from here on exactly why this recording is so reknowned and acclaimed. The tempo slows down to a crawl, the characters practically whisper to each other, and it almost feels time, and the universe, has paused. So many stage productions fluff this scene, as the singers feel obliged to project their lines to the whole audience, and often the conductor is impatient as we are nearing the end of the opera.\n\nPavarotti's sense of timing and enunciation is superb. The moment he learns that Mimi has died - the voice changes from hope and optimism, to shock, to despair and grief, accompanied by racking sobs. Karajan chooses this moment, at the closing of the opera, to bring the orchestra to a full crescendo, so our own tears are soothed by a dramatic and sonorous conclusion.","src/content/blog/2023/2023-01-20-la-boheme.md",[4450,4451],"../../../images/blog/La Boheme.jpeg","../../../images/blog/La Boheme (1).jpeg","2f48d6c1336c92ac",{"html":4454,"metadata":4455},"\u003Cp>Guess what I found in Newtown?

Inexplicably, i decided to make it even later by stopping by to have lunch on the way. So by the time I reached the exam hall, I was over an hour late. The examiners were furious with me.\n\nThe exam is more like a capstone project. There are 12 questions, I only need to choose one to answer. But it's a complex question, involving analysing lots of data, formulating a theory and presenting conclusions in a report. I further made things worse by going meta and decided to waste valuable time determining which question to answer by analysing the questions itself.

I suspected they were having problems cooking this in the kitchen, as the dish took a long time to come and the girl at the counter apologised for the delay. Finally, she said the kitchen cannot cook it to the required level of quality and decided to refund us the money. They served the dish to us anyway because we said we were happy to try it.

The salt and pepper fried tofu skins were delicious (recommendation from Adeline Lamond and Eemie Ong). The char kuay teow cannot be faulted. And we also tried sam dan wong, the classic Cantonese three egg dish that is notoriously difficult to cook perfectly. I suspected they were having problems cooking this in the kitchen, as the dish took a long time to come and the girl at the counter apologised for the delay. Finally, she said the kitchen cannot cook it to the required level of quality and decided to refund us the money. They served the dish to us anyway because we said we were happy to try it.

I particularly liked the Infinite Skyscraper (Guts) and the End of Imagination.\n\nThe Sydney Modern Project has transformed the Art Gallery of New South Wales into a unique art museum campus with two buildings and an art garden, on Gadigal Country, overlooking one of the world’s most beautiful harbours.\n\nDesigned by award-winning architects SANAA, the new building is a series of light-filled pavilions and graceful outdoor terraces that step down towards Sydney Harbour. A vast rammed earth wall cuts a dramatic curve through the building. On the lowest level of the building, discover a space like no other in Sydney: a reclaimed underground fuel bunker built during World War II and previously inaccessible to the public, which is now home to the first of a series of art projects.\n\nFor The End of Imagination, the inaugural exhibition in the Tank, Villar Rojas takes a unique opportunity to dramatise and radicalise the experience of this former wartime oil bunker that few have seen before. Set in extreme darkness where limits are not known, a host of moving lights operate as sentient beings seeking, surveying, locating, following their own paths and patterns, changing them according to their own needs and will, not ours. Among the shadows, this collective artificial gaze uncovers conflicted objects in a space that was itself born of conflict.\n\nThese traumatised objects are the product of a sculptural experiment, a hypothesis impossible to test on the terrestrial plane. Using an amalgamation of software systems collectively described as the ‘Time Engine’, Villar Rojas generated a series of intensely detailed digital worlds and placed virtual sculptures within them.\n\nSimulating conditions ranging from environmental to sociopolitical across timespans ranging from hours to millennia, the Time Engine poses unanswerable questions: What monuments might be created to commemorate the end of postcolonial struggles for independence on the Moon’s Sea of Clouds in the year 34,340? What would a sculpture that was left in the canyon of the Valles Marineris on Mars for 500 years look like? What is its texture, what remains of its volume? How do you model wind in 7,374,000 BCE?\n\nAs the extreme conditions of each world bore down on the sculptures, they became ever more complex and harrowed. Fires scorched them, altered gravity distorted them. Unrest toppled them, wars wounded them. Other life forms sheltered within or bloomed upon them. The artist modelled worlds, which in turn modelled the sculptures.\n\nIn late 2021, Villar Rojas and his team ‘downloaded’ these time-travelling virtual sculptures and commenced the labour of reconstituting them physically, his aim being to bring home faithfully the trials they endured on their journeys through turbulent digital worlds. Made with forensic intensity in a temporary workshop in Rosario, Argentina, where hands-on making was combined with machine intelligence, the resulting sculptures are layered composites of metals, plastics, concrete, soil, glass, salt, wax, resin, tree barks, metal, salvaged auto parts, recycled plastics, and a multitude of other organic and inorganic materials.\n\nIn this complex and provocative installation, both sculptures and the Tank itself – whose walls are stained with oil, graffiti and mineral traces – allude to all they’ve been through while opening still larger questions. Are they survivors or prophets? Should we revere or fear them? What discomforting knowledge do they bring us?\n\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0vNgJNa6ttR9k4yHrWv8g7ZLuV2RoPkDnYgE4Apfi1iRY6gFa2z8DEYSZdES335E1l&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"812\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\">\u003C/iframe>","src/content/blog/2023/2023-03-03-art-gallery.md",[6393],"../../../images/gallery/2023-03-03-art-gallery/Flowers that Bloom in the Cosmos (Yayoi Kusama) (1).jpeg","3c15771d3027bba4",{"html":6396,"metadata":6397},"\u003Cp>The new North building of the Art Gallery - some really impressive large scale artworks here.

Using an amalgamation of software systems collectively described as the ‘Time Engine’, Villar Rojas generated a series of intensely detailed digital worlds and placed virtual sculptures within them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Simulating conditions ranging from environmental to sociopolitical across timespans ranging from hours to millennia, the Time Engine poses unanswerable questions: What monuments might be created to commemorate the end of postcolonial struggles for independence on the Moon’s Sea of Clouds in the year 34,340? What would a sculpture that was left in the canyon of the Valles Marineris on Mars for 500 years look like? What is its texture, what remains of its volume? How do you model wind in 7,374,000 BCE?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As the extreme conditions of each world bore down on the sculptures, they became ever more complex and harrowed. Fires scorched them, altered gravity distorted them. Unrest toppled them, wars wounded them. Other life forms sheltered within or bloomed upon them. The artist modelled worlds, which in turn modelled the sculptures.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In late 2021, Villar Rojas and his team ‘downloaded’ these time-travelling virtual sculptures and commenced the labour of reconstituting them physically, his aim being to bring home faithfully the trials they endured on their journeys through turbulent digital worlds. Made with forensic intensity in a temporary workshop in Rosario, Argentina, where hands-on making was combined with machine intelligence, the resulting sculptures are layered composites of metals, plastics, concrete, soil, glass, salt, wax, resin, tree barks, metal, salvaged auto parts, recycled plastics, and a multitude of other organic and inorganic materials.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In this complex and provocative installation, both sculptures and the Tank itself – whose walls are stained with oil, graffiti and mineral traces – allude to all they’ve been through while opening still larger questions. Are they survivors or prophets? Should we revere or fear them? What discomforting knowledge do they bring us?\u003C/p>\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0vNgJNa6ttR9k4yHrWv8g7ZLuV2RoPkDnYgE4Apfi1iRY6gFa2z8DEYSZdES335E1l&#x26;show_text=true&#x26;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"812\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\">\u003C/iframe>",{"headings":6398,"imagePaths":6399,"frontmatter":6400},[],[],{"title":6381,"description":6382,"pubDate":6401,"coverImage":6393,"gallery":6387,"categories":6402,"tags":6403,"minutesRead":1976,"extra":6404},["Date","2023-03-03T05:00:00.000Z"],[442],[2214,6389],[],"2023/2023-03-03-mca",{"id":6405,"data":6407,"body":6419,"filePath":6420,"assetImports":6421,"digest":6423,"rendered":6424},{"title":6408,"description":6409,"pubDate":6410,"categories":6411,"coverImage":6414,"gallery":6415,"tags":6416},"Walking around the Rocks and MCA","Photos taken during the World Pride event",["Date","2023-03-03T01:00:00.000Z"],[6412,6413],{"id":442,"collection":440},{"id":638,"collection":440},"__ASTRO_IMAGE_../../../images/gallery/2023-03-03-mca/Free to be (1).jpeg","2023-03-03-mca",[6417,6418,5781],"The Rocks","MCA","Wandering around the Rocks and Museum of Contemporary Art Australia\n\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0ftT78iBfGyye57Y2q7YVzCBbcnCGj3HvJWwHjFEj7Et5HpPCPxCuyB9BD7V7tb1l&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"562\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\">\u003C/iframe>","src/content/blog/2023/2023-03-03-mca.md",[6422],"../../../images/gallery/2023-03-03-mca/Free to be (1).jpeg","ecb7979fe753e280",{"html":6425,"metadata":6426},"\u003Cp>Wandering around the Rocks and Museum of Contemporary Art Australia\u003C/p>\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0ftT78iBfGyye57Y2q7YVzCBbcnCGj3HvJWwHjFEj7Et5HpPCPxCuyB9BD7V7tb1l&#x26;show_text=true&#x26;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"562\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\">\u003C/iframe>",{"headings":6427,"imagePaths":6428,"frontmatter":6429},[],[],{"title":6408,"description":6409,"pubDate":6430,"coverImage":6422,"gallery":6415,"categories":6431,"tags":6432,"minutesRead":132,"extra":6433},["Date","2023-03-03T01:00:00.000Z"],[442,638],[6417,6418,5781],[],"2023/2023-03-03-salesforce",{"id":6434,"data":6436,"body":6446,"filePath":6447,"assetImports":6448,"digest":6450,"rendered":6451},{"title":6437,"description":6438,"pubDate":6439,"categories":6440,"coverImage":6442,"gallery":6443,"tags":6444},"Salesforce Tower","Tallest office building in Sydney",["Date","2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z"],[6441],{"id":704,"collection":440},"__ASTRO_IMAGE_../../../images/gallery/2023-03-03-salesforce/SalesForce Tower (2).jpeg","2023-03-03-salesforce",[2214,6445],"SalesForce Rower","The new $1.5b SalesForce Tower, the tallest office building in Sydney.

Some pointed out that comparing an ETF that rebalances with the index with a static holding is like comparing apples and oranges.\n\nI have been thinking about this, and I have a hypothesis that ETF rebalancing can result in underperformance, even if we assume zero transaction costs.\n\nMy hypothesis lies in the fact that most indexes change the weightings of assets that comprise the index relatively infrequently (possibly quarterly or even semi-annually), but an ETF has to rebalance much more frequently in order to minimise tracking error.

So, basically a buy high sell low strategy.\n\nTo prove this, I modelled a very simple market with 2 stocks over 6 pricing periods, both initially priced at $1 with a market cap of $1000. So the initial weighting of both stocks is 50% in the index. The index weighting is adjusted every 3 periods (eg. quarterly), against an ETF that rebalances every period (eg. monthly).\n\nI then tested three scenarios: a rising market where the two stocks rises at different rates, a falling market where both stocks fall at different rates, and a mixed market consisting of 1 rising stock and 1 falling stock. As can be seen from the attached spreadsheet screenshots, in all three scenarios the hypothetical ETF ends up underperforming compared to holding the assets statically (the \"correct\" behaviour since the stock's relative market cap is in line with their price changes).\n\nWhat does this imply? Ideally ETFs should rebalance at the same frequency as (or less often than) the underlying index weight adjustments. However, this may result in large tracking errors that ETF managers (or the market) may not be prepared to weather. It also means the individual investor may be better off purchasing the underlying assets and doing manual rebalancing compared to buying an ETF.\n\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid02JP1qUD8ZPJgPTEu26JJZQiA8qM1R33tN4NnU1jTdRErm4dAGKQwwfJ4u4owYUcvRl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"767\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\">\u003C/iframe>","src/content/blog/2023/2023-03-11-etf-performance.md",[6960,6961,6962],"../../../images/blog/Rising Market.png","../../../images/blog/Falling Market.png","../../../images/blog/Mixed Market.png","e0bd2a1baf336785",{"html":6965,"metadata":6966},"\u003Cp>If you recall, about a year and a half ago, I did some analysis comparing the performance of various ETFs compared to holding the underlying assets, and I arrived at the surprising result that most ETFs (perhaps all?) underperform compared to holding the physical assets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At that time, various people offered theories, including the impact of management fees and transaction costs.

For this analysis, I am selecting Betashares' Australian Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (CRED). Again, I am not picking on Betashares, the behaviour of other bond ETFs would no doubt be similar.\n\nThe reason I am selecting CRED is because the underlying index (Solactive Australian Investment Grade Corporate Bond Select TR Index) has a simple methodology - it consists of 50 corporate bonds (ranked by quality and option adjusted spread) with equal weightings. Other indices, such as Bloomberg's Australian Composite Bond has a much larger universe and hence more difficult to analyse.\n\nThe issue we saw in the previous analysis (where a bond ETF may result in significant negative total return in a falling market with rising interest rates) is also present in CRED.\n\nIt is tempting to tolerate this performance because the ETF performance is simply reflecting current market conditions and on the surface appear to track the index performance reasonably well. This is by design: ETF fund managers monitor tracking error closely and ensures their funds track the underlying index with minimal deviation.\n\nBut does the ETF truly track the index in terms of portfolio composition?\n\nConsider this: during good times in a rising market, the funds receives regular net inflows and can just buy more bonds more or less in accordance to index weight.\n\nBut in a falling market, where there is a net redemption, the fund is eventually forced to sell assets (bonds). Unlike the equity market, individual bonds can be quite illiquid and it may be quite difficult for the fund to sell assets in accordance to the desired weighting. Hence a fund is forced to choose between two alternatives: sell the more liquid bonds (which will degrade the overall quality of the portfolio over time) or try to get rid of the illiquid bonds, which may impact the underlying liquidity and and further reduce the market value of these assets, as well as incur additional transaction costs.\n\nOver time, therefore, one would expect the aftermath of a sustained falling market (such as what happened in 2022) will result in an ETF with a portfolio that significantly deviates from the idealised index weightings.\n\nAnd that has indeed happened with CRED. If I analyse the current portfolio holdings, the weightings of the bonds range from 1% to 3% instead of the ideal (2%). This means over time the credit risk of the portfolio can deviate significantly from the notional index risk even if the total return may not deviate that much.\n\nWhat does that mean for an investor? Be careful of buying ETFs where the underlying physical assets may not be liquid, as over time (particular after a significant market fall or times of crisis) the ETF may not reflect the underlying index well, even if tracking error appears to be low.

It plays an indispensable role in Australia’s engagement with the world, and a meaningful role in the life of the nation. The Biennale presents the most dynamic contemporary art from around the globe in venues across Sydney with exhibitions that ignite and surprise people, sparking dialogue, cultivating connections and inspiring action through meaningful, shared arts experiences. The Biennale of Sydney amplifies the voices of artists and tell the stories of our global communities, as they drive momentum for lasting cultural change.\n\nEstablished in 1973, it is the third oldest biennial in the world after Venice and São Paulo and the largest exhibition of its kind in Australia. The Biennale of Sydney has commissioned and presented exceptional works of art by more than 2,000 national and international artists from more than 130 countries.\n\nRivers, wetlands and other salt and freshwater ecosystems feature in the 23rd Biennale of Sydney (2022), titled rīvus, as dynamic living systems with varying degrees of political agency. Indigenous knowledges have long understood non-human entities as living ancestral beings with a right to life that must be protected. But only recently have animals, plants, mountains and bodies of water been granted legal personhood. If we can recognise them as individual beings, what might they say?\n\nrīvus invites several aqueous beings into a dialogue with artists, architects, designers, scientists, and communities, entangling multiple voices and other modes of communication to ask unlikely questions: Can a river sue us over psychoactive sewage? Will oysters grow teeth in aquatic revenge? What do the eels think? Are the swamp oracles speaking in tongues? Do algae reminisce about the days of primordial soup? Are waves the ocean’s desire? Can a waterfall refuse gravity? Considering the water ecology’s perspective entails a fundamental shift in understanding our relationship with the rest of the natural world as a porous chronicle of interwoven fates.\n\nRivers are the sediment of culture. They are givers of life, routes of communication, places of ritual, sewers and mass graves. They are witnesses and archives, our memory. As such, they have also been co-opted as natural avenues for the colonial enterprise, becoming sites of violent conflict driven by greed, exploitation and the thirst to possess. Indeed, the latin root rīvus, meaning a brook or stream, is also at the origin of the word rivalry.\n\nThe 23rd Biennale of Sydney is articulated around a series of conceptual wetlands situated along waterways of the Gadigal, Barramatagal and Cabrogal peoples. These imagined ecosystems are populated by artworks, experiments, activisms and research, which together follow the currents of meandering tributaries, expanding out into a delta of interrelated ideas including river horror, creek futurism, Indigenous science, cultural flows, ancestral technologies, counter-mapping, queer ecologies, multispecies justice, hydrofeminism, water healing, spirit streams, fish philosophy and sustainable methods of co-existence.\n\nSustainability should be an action, not a theme. rīvus will reflect on its own conditions of possibility, becoming the catalyst for works already in progress; encouraging the use of non-polluting materials and production processes; advocating for locality, collectivity, collaboration and reduced waste; acknowledging its own impact on the environment while aiming to lower it through a systemic and creative approach.\n\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0jG1eYhBUQGcvGEvd7uHRtJYoDkLecQvub6fNkuZCGqiuZeTKs9dHFs7SJj3shZDpl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"645\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\">\u003C/iframe>\n\nMore Biennale photos - these ones are from MCA\n\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid024mkpYwVw6XM7VpxSjUs3SZYha3bKXHSf62tVADjxUXjcmXSoRWw9QYQudK51gDyfl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"645\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\">\u003C/iframe>","src/content/blog/2022/2022-03-16-bos23.md",[10636],"../../../images/gallery/2022-03-16-bos23/BOS23 Rivus Barangaroo.jpeg","89e3616ef7b646bf",{"html":10639,"metadata":10640},"\u003Cp>Exploring the 23rd Biennale at Barangaroo\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Biennale of Sydney is one of the leading international contemporary art events.

For some weird reason, they had a segment on the show ranking the top Asian competitors and I was nowhere near the top 3.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid035bUoNHRHMvEt2GwDkAqvJEuAFLCdTWZdiWrv4kyboAp4ZrKLJrWTZwCxYnj9Rk27l&#x26;show_text=true&#x26;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"286\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\">\u003C/iframe>",{"headings":10745,"imagePaths":10746,"frontmatter":10747},[],[],{"title":531,"description":10733,"pubDate":10748,"categories":10749,"tags":10750,"minutesRead":132,"extra":10751},["Date","2022-03-19T00:00:00.000Z"],[528],[4096,10738],[],"2022/2022-03-19-powerhouse-museum",{"id":10752,"data":10754,"body":10765,"filePath":10766,"assetImports":10767,"digest":10769,"rendered":10770},{"title":10755,"description":10756,"pubDate":10757,"categories":10758,"coverImage":10760,"gallery":10761,"tags":10762},"Powerhouse Museum","Entry is now free",["Date","2022-03-19T01:00:00.000Z"],[10759],{"id":704,"collection":440},"__ASTRO_IMAGE_../../../images/gallery/2022-03-19-powerhouse-museum/Space (5).jpeg","2022-03-19-powerhouse-museum",[10763,10764],"Powerhouse","museum","A day at the Powerhouse museum.

I was going out for dinner with a friend, and he was describing the problems he was having at work. Apparently they were having problems choosing between two designs. I said I have never had any problems making design decisions and justifying them. He set a challenge, and asked me to pick between two very similar bathroom designs, and explain my rationale to someone I didn't know on the end of a phone.\n\nThe two bathroom designs look very similar, different only in minor details. I was about to randomly pick Bathroom A, on the basis that the fixtures had a little bit more bling and chrome, but then I realised this was a trick choice. Bathroom B had more refined and higher quality fixtures, and overall the placement of the fixtures were a little more balanced. So I explained all this to the disembodied person over the phone.\n\nTo my surprise, my dinner companion and the person over the phone were amazed and impressed with what is essentially just me opening my big mouth.\n\nAfter that I had a lucrative career as a design consultant. I flew all over the world just give people my opinion of different designs.\n\nOne day a client commented on my dress sense (wearing different shades of pink).

I was going out for dinner with a friend, and he was describing the problems he was having at work. Apparently they were having problems choosing between two designs. I said I have never had any problems making design decisions and justifying them.

I was about to randomly pick Bathroom A, on the basis that the fixtures had a little bit more bling and chrome, but then I realised this was a trick choice. Bathroom B had more refined and higher quality fixtures, and overall the placement of the fixtures were a little more balanced.

Why?\nLet's deal with the most obvious, and less important reasons first.\n\nFirst of all, cost and frustration. Travel is relatively expensive at the moment, due to high inflation and fuel costs. Airlines globally shed staff during the pandemic lockdown, and the industry have collectively lost a lot of efficiency and effectiveness. Expect delays, cancellations, lost baggage and missed flights until things get sorted out again.\n\nSecondly, the pandemic isn't over. Last I checked, hundreds of thousands of people are still catching COVID-19 every day around the world. Vaccinations that protect against newer strains are only just coming out. There may be a new more deadly or infectious mutation around the corner. Borders can re-close very quickly and travellers could end up being stranded just like in 2020 when people were desperately trying to pay $50,000+ for first class tickets in a last ditch attempt to return home.\n\nThirdly, we have never been closer to World War III than right now. As you know, Russia invaded Ukraine but isn't winning. Russia's economy is tumbling due to the combined effect of funding the war and economic sanctions from other nations. Putin's future is increasingly shakey and rumours are his health isn't that great. The temptation to push that big red nuke button must be stronger each and every day and he has already threatened it. Biden has hinted retaliation in kind if that happens. China's economy isn't looking too great either due to the zero covid policy and collapse in the construction and tech industries - China might well be tempted to invade Taiwan if WW3 breaks out because China thinks the US will be distracted. All this translates to massive disruption and risk in travel. Remember MH17 was shot down over east Ukraine, and that was before the current conflict. Sure, none of this might happen in the near future. Or, it might.\n\nLastly (and the best reason): world markets are in severe decline due to a combination of fears (see above), inflation and rising interest rates. The best time to save money is RIGHT NOW. As a friend of mine used to say, a market crash is like an end of year clearance sale at your department store - it's time to hunt for bargains. Eventually it will be a great time to invest. Our portfolio doubled in value after the GFC. Any money you save can go towards making you more money in the short term.

Seating takes advantage each season, the filtered spring sunshine of the prunus in full flower, or the full sun of winter in a sheltered corner.\n\nA magnificent Italianate fountain takes pride of place in a courtyard. Beyond a Japanese-style garden where Maples, ferns and potted bamboo thrive, protected by a great oak. A path flanked by eight ‘Shimidsu Sakura’ prunus leads down to a tea-house, where the sun’s first and last rays penetrate at low angles.\n\nA frog-pond, lying beneath a willow and a purple magnolia, is the perfect place for enjoying a cool drink beside the water on a summer’s evening.\n\n## Garden 8 (The Old Orchard)\n\nAn expansive, five-acre garden ‘The Old Orchard’ invites visitors to explore its many beautiful features. From the large duck pond edged with shrubs and perennials, to sculptures placed around the grounds, arbours covered in flowers, or wandering paths tucked into a hidden corner beyond a wooden bridge over a stream.\n\nTall, well-established London plane trees line the driveway. Roses, perennials and shrubs of rhododendron, camellia and azalea form a more formal aspect of the garden. A semi-enclosed courtyard with a beautiful stone wall offsets a spectacular display of climbing roses.\n\nOne corner of the property houses a large, covered vegetable garden with fruit trees inside and out.\n\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchris1.tham%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0341xXfLCEqDUVCTWMLL5oaCRqPYcNxHgRqvzxrXcMYjqw2J7xRYML7yWa6ziZWFxdl&show_text=true&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"704\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\">\u003C/iframe>","src/content/blog/2022/2022-10-30-bundanoon.md",[17069],"../../../images/gallery/2022-10-30-bundanoon/The Old Orchard (20).jpeg","68633eb4678883f0",{"html":17072,"metadata":17073},"\u003Cp>Bundanoon, home to the Garden Ramble, is the ‘Quintessential Southern Highlands Experience’ and the perfect village alternative to the larger towns of Bowral, Mittagong and Moss Vale…the perfect place to relax and unwind.

Everything about it - the direct drive motor, the pitch control with stroboscope control, the S-shaped arm, just screamed high tech.

A vibrant and diverse coastal metropolis, Sydney is home to iconic attractions, boasts a magnificent harbour and has a buzzing art, culinary and surf scene. With a calendar of exciting festivals and events, Sydney is the natural next destination of SEE LV’s 2022 journey. Mixing archival objects from the Maison’s heritage collection with recent creations, SEE LV allows visitors to delve deep into the world of Louis Vuitton through immersive and interactive digital experiences. Uncovering all facets of Louis Vuitton’s history and creations through a contemporary lens, the exhibition brings together a remarkable collection of modern pieces and early twentieth-century trunks, artistic collaborations and iconic leather creations.\n\nUpon entry, visitors are greeted by a portrait of young Louis Vuitton conceived by artist Refik Anadol using Artificial Intelligence. The exhibition continues to a room featuring a reverse-chronology selection of ready-to-wear pieces, where an exquisite 19th gown stands alongside a historical 1906 trunk, illustrating the Maison’s longstanding relationship with fashion. From the Steamer Trunk to the Speedy, Noe to Twist, a wall of Louis Vuitton’s most iconic bags and images of their celebrity friends such as Miranda Kerr, Jennifer Connelly, Samara Weaving, and Hugh Jackman display how these signature shapes have continued to inspire throughout the times. Next, an entire room is dedicated to Louis Vuitton’s major contributions to the invention of luggage typologies, ranging from the iconic Wardrobe trunk to the Skateboard trunk, showing how each one has been a cornerstone in the evolution of new lifestyles and traveling habits.

Encapsulating Zampatti’s trailblazing career from the establishment of her business to her most recent work, the exhibition draws over five decades of material.\n\nIn 1965, Zampatti established the Sydney fashion house and brand that is still loved by generations of women. Over more than five decades, Zampatti thrived through periods of enormous change while refining her design ethos of simplicity, understatement and strength. This is the first exhibition to chart the course of Australia’s longest-working fashion designer, acknowledging Zampatti’s manifold achievements and impact on Australian life.\n\nThe major exhibition features 100 outfits, including personal items from Zampatti’s estate, the Carla Zampatti Fashion Archive, the wardrobes of well-known women and the results of hundreds of responses to a public callout. The garments trace the evolution of Zampatti’s style from the youthful spirit of the 1960s and 1970s to the relaxed sophistication of later years. The exhibition centres on the many beloved ‘Carlas’, retained for decades, and the stories through which Zampatti’s clothing is interwoven.

Encapsulating Zampatti’s trailblazing career from the establishment of her business to her most recent work, the exhibition draws over five decades of material.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 1965, Zampatti established the Sydney fashion house and brand that is still loved by generations of women. Over more than five decades, Zampatti thrived through periods of enormous change while refining her design ethos of simplicity, understatement and strength. This is the first exhibition to chart the course of Australia’s longest-working fashion designer, acknowledging Zampatti’s manifold achievements and impact on Australian life.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The major exhibition features 100 outfits, including personal items from Zampatti’s estate, the Carla Zampatti Fashion Archive, the wardrobes of well-known women and the results of hundreds of responses to a public callout. The garments trace the evolution of Zampatti’s style from the youthful spirit of the 1960s and 1970s to the relaxed sophistication of later years. The exhibition centres on the many beloved ‘Carlas’, retained for decades, and the stories through which Zampatti’s clothing is interwoven. Highlights include rarely seen designs from her early career and loans from clients including HRH Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Dame Quentin Bryce AD CVO, the Hon Linda Burney MP, and women from around Australia.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Two monumental audio and video installations explore Zampatti’s world through her own voice and intimate conversations between family, close friends, employees, clients and heads of businesses, arts, multicultural and charitable organisations which she supported over her lifetime.

Warning: this post is going to be controversial. By all means post your counter thoughts.\n\nFrom a macro perspective, we are definitely living in \"interesting times.\" We've come from a 30 year period of declining interest rates, which has fueled tech innovation funded by cheap capital. We have just survived a worldwide pandemic which has disrupted supply chains, and there is an energy crunch caused by a war and a perhaps a too slow transition to alternative energy sources to address climate change. The geopolitical axis is shifting, and rising nationalism seeks to redraw political boundaries and trade balances. Social media has changed the way we view the world and our behaviour and beliefs. AI will not only change the dynamics of the workforce but also the dynamics of creativity. The climate is changing, and perhaps we are also changing as a species, mentally and physically.\n\nWhat does all that mean in terms of #investing? First of all, some are predicting we are entering a potentially prolonged period of high volatility, interest rates and inflation. Many are saying the US will enter into a recession next year, and perhaps this will affect the rest of the world. We have become globalised and interconnected, and investment markets and asset classes around the world are increasingly correlated. Tech innovation and growth will slow down as the era of \"free capital\" disappears.\n\nSo here's the controversial part of my post. The fundamental rules of investing are changing. I believe Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) has failed us and may no longer apply in the future. The whole idea of MPT is that there is an efficient frontier from investing in a basket of diversified assets. That there is an \"optimal\" investment strategy depending on your risk tolerance.\n\nHowever, globalisation has reduced correlation between assets and markets. For perhaps the first time, we are seeing a decline in all asset classes. Decreased growth prospects and increased volatility may mean it no longer makes sense to (over) diversify. Liquidity, stability and income may become the new yardsticks of investing.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a shift from active investing (timed stock selection) to passive investing (tracking a market index). Perhaps there is no long term positive alpha, and even factor investing and the notion of picking value may be questionable.\n\nWhat remains? Minimising beta (volatility) is still worthwhile. There is some evidence that pursuing high income may lead to overall higher total return than pursuing growth, particularly as growth slows and sustainability becomes important. It may no longer makes sense to hold cash (rather than say a basket of liquid assets) and it may no longer makes sense to balance across asset classes just for the sake of balancing.\n\nHolding a basket of underlying stocks may be better than tracking an index.
